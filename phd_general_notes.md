Notes on general biophysics, physics, math, and science, PhD, life:

# What do I want to make sure I get out of my PhD (Transferable skills)
* Better understanding of myself
	- What I like
	- How I think
	- My Weaknesses and getting better at things

* Communication skills
	- How to communicate across anything to any one
		- Presentation
		- Writing
	- Perfect grammar and a set of stylist tools to use in most situations

* Problem solving/learning
	- How to approach any problem and get started in learning anything

* Selling myself
	- How to pitch what I do and make myself sound good without sounding like its bragging
	- How to make stuff sound good ...

* Know when to give up

* Decision making
	- when to drop a project 
	- when to keep going
	- what to ignore
	- what not to ignore
	- conviction
	- questioning from many angles

* Being comfortable with continuous learning and encountering often stuff that I don't understand

* How to approach things that I don't have experience in or don't understand

* Formulating and developing a research project

* Teaching/Mentoring


## fundamentals
Questions that *always* comes up in the lab:
- technical stuff
	- check my simulation status
	- file management - making work more efficient

- Academics
	- Grad school, problem solving, presentations (audience), eliciting excitement, selling ...
	- Commonly asked question: I have no results, but what would I present?
		- Background, motivation, objectives, hypothesis, rationale, study design. all of these things comes before any results and conclusions.  Spending time here will clarify everything else that you are doing. Rushing ahead to get results and data collection, blindly often causes time wasting, but its what people do to get things done before they understand anything.  Doing comes before understanding - this is what happens in the lab. Why? because you need to utilize techniques from many different fields to get anything done in the lab.
	- Bottle necks to progress
		- Where to start?
		- How to start?
		- Tough language to cut through ... somebody show you how to get started - this is training
		
	- What does it all mean, why am I doing what I am doing
		- understanding the rationale behind the work
- how do I know if my simulation is correct?
	- This is related to whether the simulation is converged
	- I *want* develop a software suite implementing a basis set of criteria to help diagnose MD simulations
		- I think we need this more than ever because of how rapidly data is being produced

Any ideas I have related to science

# Side projects
	- "Continuous Boltzmann Jumping"
		- Equation in Edna 2010 paper with Hummer
		- Not published and described in thesis
		- Talk to Tom about it
		- Need a system to test it
	## Software projects
		- What could I develop that would be useful for students people in academia
			- Examples include David's ideas of computation work flow manager, collaborative writiing editor with Mendeley
			- Things for writing
			- MD related tools
				- eg. MD analysis, GromacsWrapper by Oliver beckstein
