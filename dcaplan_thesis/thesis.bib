	Abstract = {The goal of this review is to establish a broad and rigorous theoretical framework to describe ion permeation through biological channels. This framework is developed in the context of atomic models on the basis of the statistical mechanical projection-operator formalism of Mori and Zwanzig. The review is divided into two main parts. The first part introduces the fundamental concepts needed to construct a hierarchy of dynamical models at different level of approximation. In particular, the potential of mean force (PMF) as a configuration-dependent free energy is introduced, and its significance concerning equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena is discussed. In addition, fundamental aspects of membrane electrostatics, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the transmembrane potential, as well as important computational techniques for extracting essential information from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are described and discussed. The first part of the review provides a theoretical formalism to 'translate' the information from the atomic structure into the familiar language of phenomenological models of ion permeation. The second part is aimed at reviewing and contrasting results obtained in recent computational studies of three very different channels: the gramicidin A (gA) channel, which is a narrow one-ion pore (at moderate concentration), the KcsA channel from Streptomyces lividans, which is a narrow multi-ion pore, and the outer membrane matrix porin F (OmpF) from Escherichia coli, which is a trimer of three beta-barrel subunits each forming wide aqueous multi-ion pores. Comparison with experiments demonstrates that current computational models are approaching semi-quantitative accuracy and are able to provide significant insight into the microscopic mechanisms of ion conduction and selectivity. We conclude that all-atom MD with explicit water molecules can represent important structural features of complex biological channels accurately, including such features as the location of ion-binding sites along the permeation pathway. We finally discuss the broader issue of the validity of ion permeation models and an outlook to the future.},

@article{Patel:2004p6622,
	Abstract = {A fluctuating charge (FQ) force field is applied to molecular dynamics simulations for six small proteins in explicit polarizable solvent represented by the TIP4P-FQ potential. The proteins include 1FSV, 1ENH, 1PGB, 1VII, 1H8K, and 1CRN, representing both helical and beta-sheet secondary structural elements. Constant pressure and temperature (NPT) molecular dynamics simulations are performed on time scales of several nanoseconds, the longest simulations yet reported using explicitly polarizable all-atom empirical potentials (for both solvent and protein) in the condensed phase. In terms of structure, the FQ force field allows deviations from native structure up to 2.5 A (with a range of 1.0 to 2.5 A). This is commensurate to the performance of the CHARMM22 nonpolarizable model and other currently existing polarizable models. Importantly, secondary structural elements maintain native structure in general to within 1 A (both helix and beta-strands), again in good agreement with the nonpolarizable case. In qualitative agreement with QM/MM ab initio dynamics on crambin (Liu et al. Proteins 2001, 44, 484), there is a sequence dependence of average condensed phase atomic charge for all proteins, a dependence one would anticipate considering the differing chemical environments around individual atoms; this is a subtle quantum mechanical feature captured in the FQ model but absent in current state-of-the-art nonpolarizable models. Furthermore, there is a mutual polarization of solvent and protein in the condensed phase. Solvent dipole moment distributions within the first and second solvation shells around the protein display a shift towards higher dipole moments (increases on the order of 0.2-0.3 Debye) relative to the bulk; protein polarization is manifested via the enhanced condensed phase charges of typical polar atoms such as backbone carbonyl oxygens, amide nitrogens, and amide hydrogens. Finally, to enlarge the sample set of proteins, gas-phase minimizations and 1 ps constant temperature simulations are performed on various-sized proteins to compare to earlier work by Kaminsky et al. (J Comp Chem 2002, 23, 1515). The present work establishes the feasibility of applying a fully polarizable force field for protein simulations and demonstrates the approach employed in extending the CHARMM force field to include these effects.},

@article{Patel:2004p6626,
	Abstract = {A first-generation fluctuating charge (FQ) force field to be ultimately applied for protein simulations is presented. The electrostatic model parameters, the atomic hardnesses, and electronegativities, are parameterized by fitting to DFT-based charge responses of small molecules perturbed by a dipolar probe mimicking a water dipole. The nonbonded parameters for atoms based on the CHARMM atom-typing scheme are determined via simultaneously optimizing vacuum water-solute geometries and energies (for a set of small organic molecules) and condensed phase properties (densities and vaporization enthalpies) for pure bulk liquids. Vacuum solute-water geometries, specifically hydrogen bond distances, are fit to 0.19 A r.m.s. error, while dimerization energies are fit to 0.98 kcal/mol r.m.s. error. Properties of the liquids studied include bulk liquid structure and polarization. The FQ model does indeed show a condensed phase effect in the shifting of molecular dipole moments to higher values relative to the gas phase. The FQ liquids also appear to be more strongly associated, in the case of hydrogen bonding liquids, due to the enhanced dipolar interactions as evidenced by shifts toward lower energies in pair energy distributions. We present results from a short simulation of NMA in bulk TIP4P-FQ water as a step towards simulating solvated peptide/protein systems. As expected, there is a nontrivial dipole moment enhancement of the NMA (although the quantitative accuracy is difficult to assess). Furthermore, the distribution of dipole moments of water molecules in the vicinity of the solutes is shifted towards larger values by 0.1-0.2 Debye in keeping with previously reported work.},

	Abstract = { Water near hydrophobic surfaces is like that at a liquid-vapor interface, where fluctuations in water density are substantially enhanced compared to that in bulk water. Here we use molecular simulations with specialized sampling techniques to show that water density fluctuations are similarly enhanced, even near hydrophobic surfaces of complex biomolecules, situating them at the edge of a dewetting transition. Consequently, water near these surfaces is sensitive to subtle changes in surface conformation, topology, and chemistry, any of which can tip the balance towards or away from the wet state, and thus significantly alter biomolecular interactions and function. Our work also resolves the long-standing puzzle of why some biological surfaces dewet and other seemingly similar surfaces do not. },

	Abstract = {We have computed the pK(a)'s of the ionizable residues of a protein ion channel, the Staphylococcus aureus toxin alpha-hemolysin, by using two types of input structures, namely the crystal structure of the heptameric alpha-hemolysin and a set of over four hundred snapshots from a 4.38 ns Molecular Dynamics simulation of the protein inserted in a phospholipid planar bilayer. The comparison of the dynamic picture provided by the Molecular Simulation with the static one based on the X-ray crystal structure of the protein embedded in a lipid membrane allows analyzing the influence of the fluctuations in the protein structure on its ionization properties. We find that the use of the dynamic structure provides interesting information about the sensitivity of the computed pK(a) of a given residue to small changes in the local structure. The calculated pK(a) are consistent with previous indirect estimations obtained from single-channel conductance and selectivity measurements.},

	Abstract = {The use of macroscopic electrostatic models to calculate the relative energetics of protonation states and the pH-titration properties of ionizable groups in proteins is described. These methods treat the protein as an irregularly-shaped low-dielectric object containing embedded atomic charges immersed in a high-dielectric (solvent) medium. The energetics of altering protonation states then involves the electrostatic work of altering the embedded atomic charges. The governing electrostatic equation is either the Poisson or linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which generally requires numerical solution. A tutorial approach is taken, the main aim of which is a thorough understanding of the method.},

	Abstract = {The problem of including solvent effects in molecular mechanics calculations is discussed. It is argued that the neglect of charge-solvent (solvation) interactions can introduce significant errors. The finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) method for calculating electrostatic interactions is summarized and is used as a basis for introducing a new pairwise energy term which accounts for charge-solvent interactions. This term acts between all pairs of atoms usually considered in molecular mechanics calculations and can be easily incorporated into existing force fields. As an example, a parameterization is developed for the CHARMm force field and the results compared to the predictions of the FDPB method. An approach to the realistic incorporation of solvent screening into force fields is also outlined.},

	Abstract = {Electrostatic free energy is useful for correlating structure with function in proteins in which ionizable groups play essential functional roles. To this end, the pK(a) values of ionizable groups must be known and their molecular determinants must be understood. Structure-based calculations of electrostatic energies and pK(a) values are necessary for this purpose. This unit describes protocols for pK(a) calculations with continuum electrostatics methods based on the numerical solution of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation by the method of finite differences. Critical discussion of key parameters, approximations, and shortcomings of these methods is included. Two protocols are described for calculations with methods modified empirically to maximize agreement between measured and calculated pK(a) values. Applied judiciously, these methods can contribute useful and novel insight into properties of surface ionizable groups in proteins.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayers using the CHARMM27 force field in the tensionless isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble give highly ordered, gel-like bilayers with an area per lipid of approximately 48 A(2). To obtain fluid (L(alpha)) phase properties of DPPC bilayers represented by the CHARMM energy function in this ensemble, we reparameterized the atomic partial charges in the lipid headgroup and upper parts of the acyl chains. The new charges were determined from the electron structure using both the Mulliken method and the restricted electrostatic potential fitting method. We tested the derived charges in molecular dynamics simulations of a fully hydrated DPPC bilayer. Only the simulation with the new restricted electrostatic potential charges shows significant improvements compared with simulations using the original CHARMM27 force field resulting in an area per lipid of 60.4 +/- 0.1 A(2). Compared to the 48 A(2), the new value of 60.4 A(2) is in fair agreement with the experimental value of 64 A(2). In addition, the simulated order parameter profile and electron density profile are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. Thus, the biologically more interesting fluid phase of DPPC bilayers can now be simulated in all-atom simulations in the NPT ensemble by employing our modified CHARMM27 force field.},

@article{Taylor:2009p7408,
	Abstract = {A recently defined charge set, to be used in conjunction with the all-atom CHARMM27r force field, has been validated for a series of phosphatidylcholine lipids. The work of Sonne et al. successfully replicated experimental bulk membrane behaviour for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) under the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble. Previous studies using the defined CHARMM27r charge set have resulted in lateral membrane contraction when used in the tensionless NPT ensemble, forcing the lipids to adopt a more ordered conformation than predicted experimentally. The current study has extended the newly defined charge set to 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PDPC). Molecular dynamics simulations were run for each of the lipids (including DPPC) using both the CHARMM27r charge set and the newly defined modified charge set. In all three cases a significant improvement was seen in both bulk membrane properties and individual atomistic effects. Membrane width, area per lipid and the depth of water penetration were all seen to converge to experimental values. Deuterium order parameters generated with the new charge set showed increased disorder across the width of the bilayer and reflected both results from experiment and similar simulations run with united atom models. These newly validated models can now find use in mixed biological simulations under the tensionless ensemble without concern for lateral contraction.},

	Abstract = {Proton translocation in the D-pathway of cytochrome c oxidase has been studied by a combination of classical molecular dynamics and the multistate empirical valence bond methodology. This approach allows for explicit Grotthuss proton hopping between water molecules. According to mutagenesis experiments, the role of proton donor/acceptor along the D-pathway is carried by the highly conserved residue Glu-242. The present multistate empirical valence bond simulations indicate that the protonation/deprotonation state of Glu-242 is strongly coupled to the distance of proton propagation in the D-pathway. The proton was seen to travel the full length of the D-pathway when Glu-242 was deprotonated; however, it was trapped halfway along the path when Glu-242 was protonated. Further investigation in terms of both proton dynamical properties and free energy calculations for the pathway of proton transport provides evidence for a two-step proton transport mechanism in the D-pathway.},

	Abstract = {We report first-principles molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory performed on the entrance part of the D-path pathway in bovine cytochrome c oxidase. Our models, which are extracted from the fully reduced and oxidized X-ray structures, include His503 as a protonatable site. We find that the protonated His503 with the deprotonated Asp91 [H503-N(δ1)H(+) and D91-C(γ)OO(γ)] are more energetically favorable than other protonation states, [H503-N(δ1) and D91-C(γ)OOH], with an energy difference of about -5kcal/mol in reduced case, while the [H503-N(δ1)H+ and D91-C(γ)OO(-)] state is energetically unstable, about +3kcal/mol higher in energy in the oxidized case. The local interaction of His503 with the surrounding polar residues is necessary and sufficient for determining the energetics. The redox-coupled rotation of His503 is found to change the energetics of the protonation states. We also find that this rotation is coupled with the proton transfer from His503 and Asp91, which leads to the transition between the two different protonation states. This study suggests that His503 is involved in the proton supply to the D-path as a proton acceptor and that the redox-controlled proton-transfer-coupled rotation of His503 is a key process for an effective proton supply to the D-path from water bulk.

	Abstract = {In the membrane-bound redox-driven proton pump cytochrome c oxidase, electron- and proton-transfer reactions must be coupled, which requires controlled modulation of the kinetic and/or thermodynamic properties of proton-transfer reactions through the membrane-spanning part of the protein. In this study we have investigated proton-transfer reactions through a pathway that is used for the transfer of both substrate and pumped protons in cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Specifically, we focus on the formation of the so-called F intermediate, which is rate limited by an internal proton-transfer reaction from a possible branching point in the pathway, at a glutamic-acid residue (E(I-286)), to the binuclear center. We have also studied the reprotonation of E(I-286) from the bulk solution. Evaluation of the data in terms of a model presented in this work gives a rate of internal proton transfer from E(I-286) to the proton acceptor at the catalytic site of 1.1 x 10(4) s(-1). The apparent pK(a) of the donor (E(I-286)), determined from the pH dependence of the F-formation kinetics, was found to be 9.4, while the pK(a) of the proton acceptor at the catalytic site is likely to be > or = 2.5 pH units higher. In the pH range up to pH 10 the proton equilibrium between the bulk solution and E(I-286) was much faster than 10(4) s(-1), while in the pH range above pH 10 the proton uptake from solution is rate limiting for the overall reaction. The apparent second-order rate constant for proton transfer from the bulk solution to E(I-286) is >10(13) M(-1) s(-1), which indicates that the proton uptake is assisted by a local buffer consisting of protonatable residues at the protein surface.},

@article{Aoyama:2009p10495,
	Abstract = {The fully oxidized form of cytochrome c oxidase, immediately after complete oxidation of the fully reduced form, pumps protons upon each of the initial 2 single-electron reduction steps, whereas protons are not pumped during single-electron reduction of the fully oxidized "as-isolated" form (the fully oxidized form without any reduction/oxidation treatment) [Bloch D, et al. (2004) The catalytic cycle of cytochrome c oxidase is not the sum of its two halves. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:529-533]. For identification of structural differences causing the remarkable functional difference between these 2 distinct fully oxidized forms, the X-ray structure of the fully oxidized as-isolated bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase was determined at 1.95-A resolution by limiting the X-ray dose for each shot and by using many (approximately 400) single crystals. This minimizes the effects of hydrated electrons induced by the X-ray irradiation. The X-ray structure showed a peroxide group bridging the 2 metal sites in the O(2) reduction site (Fe(3+)-O(-)-O(-)-Cu(2+)), in contrast to a ferric hydroxide (Fe(3+)-OH(-)) in the fully oxidized form immediately after complete oxidation from the fully reduced form, as has been revealed by resonance Raman analyses. The peroxide-bridged structure is consistent with the reductive titration results showing that 6 electron equivalents are required for complete reduction of the fully oxidized as-isolated form. The structural difference between the 2 fully oxidized forms suggests that the bound peroxide in the O(2) reduction site suppresses the proton pumping function.},

	Abstract = {The structure of the two-subunit cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans has been refined using X-ray cryodata to 2.25 A resolution in order to gain further insights into its mechanism of action. The refined structural model shows a number of new features including many additional solvent and detergent molecules. The electron density bridging the heme a(3) iron and Cu(B) of the active site is fitted best by a peroxo-group or a chloride ion. Two waters or OH(-) groups do not fit, one water (or OH(-)) does not provide sufficient electron density. The analysis of crystals of cytochrome c oxidase isolated in the presence of bromide instead of chloride appears to exclude chloride as the bridging ligand. In the D-pathway a hydrogen bonded chain of six water molecules connects Asn131 and Glu278, but the access for protons to this water chain is blocked by Asn113, Asn131 and Asn199. The K-pathway contains two firmly bound water molecules, an additional water chain seems to form its entrance. Above the hemes a cluster of 13 water molecules is observed which potentially form multiple exit pathways for pumped protons. The hydrogen bond pattern excludes that the Cu(B) ligand His326 is present in the imidazolate form.},

	Abstract = {The O(2) reduction site of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), comprising iron (Fe(a3)) and copper (Cu(B)) ions, is probed by x-ray structural analyses of CO, NO, and CN(-) derivatives to investigate the mechanism of the complete reduction of O(2). Formation of the derivative contributes to the trigonal planar coordination of and displaces one of its three coordinated imidazole groups while a water molecule becomes hydrogen bonded to both the CN(-) ligand and the hydroxyl group of Tyr244. When O(2) is bound to Fe2+a3 , it is negatively polarized (O2- ), and expected to induce the same structural change induced by CN(-). This structural change allows to receive three electron equivalents nonsequentially from Cu1B+, Fe3+a3, and Tyr-OH, providing complete reduction of O(2) with minimization of production of active oxygen species. The proton-pumping pathway of bovine CcO comprises a hydrogen-bond network and a water channel which extend to the positive and negative side surfaces, respectively. Protons transferred through the water channel are pumped through the hydrogen-bond network electrostatically with positive charge created at the Fe(a) center by electron donation to the O(2) reduction site. Binding of CO or NO to induces significant narrowing of a section of the water channel near the hydrogen-bond network junction, which prevents access of water molecules to the network. In a similar manner, O(2) binding to is expected to prevent access of water molecules to the hydrogen-bond network. This blocks proton back-leak from the network and provides an efficient gate for proton-pumping.},

	Abstract = {Potassium is the major intracellular cation in bacteria as well as in eucaryotic cells. Bacteria accumulate K+ by a number of different transport systems that vary in kinetics, energy coupling, and regulation. The Trk and Kdp systems of enteric organisms have been well studied and are found in many distantly related species. The Ktr system, resembling Trk in many ways, is also found in many bacteria. In most species two or more independent saturable K(+)-transport systems are present. The KefB and KefC type of system that is activated by treatment of cells with toxic electrophiles is the only specific K(+)-efflux system that has been well characterized. Pressure-activated channels of at least three types are found in bacteria; these represent nonspecific paths of efflux when turgor pressure is dangerously high. A close homolog of eucaryotic K+ channels is found in many bacteria, but its role remains obscure. K+ transporters are regulated both by ion concentrations and turgor. A very general property is activation of K+ uptake by an increase in medium osmolarity. This response is modulated by both internal and external concentrations of K+. Kdp is the only K(+)-transport system whose expression is regulated by environmental conditions. Decrease in turgor pressure and/or reduction in external K+ rapidly increase expression of Kdp. The signal created by these changes, inferred to be reduced turgor, is transmitted by the KdpD sensor kinase to the KdpE-response regulator that in turn stimulates transcription of the kdp genes. K+ acts as a cytoplasmic-signaling molecule, activating and/or inducing enzymes and transport systems that allow the cell to adapt to elevated osmolarity. The signal could be ionic strength or specifically K+. This signaling response is probably mediated by a direct sensing of internal ionic strength by each particular system and not by a component or system that coordinates this response by different systems to elevated K+.},

	Abstract = {Potassium transport plays three distinct roles in mitochondria. Volume homeostasis to prevent excess matrix swelling is a housekeeping function that is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the organelle. This function is mediated by the K(+)/H(+) antiporter and was first proposed by Peter Mitchell. Volume homeostasis to prevent excess matrix contraction is a recently discovered function that maintains a fully expanded matrix when diffusive K(+) influx declines due to membrane depolarization caused by high rates of electron transport. Maintaining matrix volume under these conditions is important because matrix contraction inhibits electron transport and also perturbs the structure-function of the intermembrane space (IMS). This volume regulation is mediated by the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channel (mitoK(ATP)). Cell signaling functions to protect the cell from ischemia-reperfusion injury and also to trigger transcription of genes required for cell growth. This function depends on the ability of mitoK(ATP) opening to trigger increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review discusses the properties of the mitochondrial K(+) cycle that help to understand the basis of these diverse effects.},

	Abstract = {A hydrogen-bonded network is observed above the hemes in all of the high-resolution crystal structures of cytochrome oxidases. It includes water and a pair of arginines, R481 and R482 (Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering), that interact directly with heme a and the heme a(3) propionates. The hydrogen-bonded network provides potential pathways for proton release. The arginines, and the backbone peptide bond between them, have also been proposed to form part of a facilitated electron transfer route between Cu(A) and heme a. Our studies show that mutations of R482 (K, Q, and A) and R481 (K) retain substantial activity and are able to pump protons, but at somewhat reduced rates and stoichiometries. A slowed rate of electron transfer from cytochrome c to Cu(A) suggests a change in the orientation of cytochrome c binding in all but the R to K mutants. The mutant R482P is more perturbed in its structure and is altered in the redox potential difference between heme a and Cu(A): +18 mV for R482P and +46 mV for the wild type (heme a - Cu(A)). The electron transfer rate between Cu(A) and heme a is also altered from 93000 s(-1) in the wild type to 50 s(-1) in the oxidized R482P mutant, reminiscent of changes observed in a Cu(A)-ligand mutant, H260N. In neither case is the approximately 2000-fold change in the rate accounted for by the altered redox potentials, suggesting that both cause a major modification in the path or reorganization energy of electron transfer.},

	Abstract = {The recently reported X-ray structures of cytochrome oxidase reveal structures that are likely proton-conducting channels. One of these channels, leading from the negative aqueous surface to the heme a3/CuB bimetallic center, contains a lysine as a central element. Previous work has shown that this lysine (K362 in the oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides) is essential for cytochrome c oxidase activity. The data presented demonstrate that the K362M mutant is impeded in the reduction of the heme a3/CuB bimetallic center, probably by interfering with the intramolecular movement of protons. The reduction of the heme-copper center is required prior to the reaction with dioxygen to form the so-called peroxy intermediate (compound P). This block can be by-passed to some extent by the addition of H2O2, which can react with the enzyme without prereduction of the heme-copper center and can then be reduced to water using electrons from cytochrome c. Hence, the K362M mutant, though lacking oxidase activity, exhibits cytochrome c peroxidase activity. Rapid mixing techniques have been used to determine the kinetics of this peroxidase activity at concentrations of H2O2 up to 0.5 M. The Km for peroxide is about 50 mM and the Vmax is 50 electrons s-1, which is considerably slower than the turnover that can be obtained for the oxidase activity of the wild-type enzyme (1200 s-1). The turnover of the mutant oxidase with H2O2 appears to be limited by the rate of reaction of the enzyme with peroxide to form compound P, rather than the rate of reduction of compound P to water by cytochrome c. The data require a reexamination of the proposed roles of the putative proton-conducting channels.},

	Abstract = {X-ray structures of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase have suggested that the enzyme, which reduces O(2) in a process coupled with a proton pumping process, contains a proton pumping pathway (H-pathway) composed of a hydrogen bond network and a water channel located in tandem across the enzyme. The hydrogen bond network includes the peptide bond between Tyr-440 and Ser-441, which could facilitate unidirectional proton transfer. Replacement of a possible proton-ejecting aspartate (Asp-51) at one end of the H-pathway with asparagine, using a stable bovine gene expression system, abolishes the proton pumping activity without influencing the O(2) reduction function. Blockage of either the water channel by a double mutation (Val386Leu and Met390Trp) or proton transfer through the peptide by a Ser441Pro mutation was found to abolish the proton pumping activity without impairment of the O(2) reduction activity. These results significantly strengthen the proposal that H-pathway is involved in proton pumping.},

@article{Lee:2000p10296,
	Abstract = {As the final electron acceptor in the respiratory chain of eukaryotic and many prokaryotic organisms, cytochrome c oxidase catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water, concomitantly generating a proton gradient. X-ray structures of two cytochrome c oxidases have been reported, and in each structure three possible pathways for proton translocation are indicated: the D-, K-, and H-channels. The putative H-channel is most clearly delineated in the bovine heart oxidase and has been proposed to be functionally important for the translocation of pumped protons in the mammalian oxidase [Yoshikawa et al. (1998) Science 280, 1723-1729]. In the present work, the functional importance of residues lining the putative H-channel in the oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides are examined by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants were generated in eight different sites and the enzymes have been purified and characterized. The results suggest that the H-channel is not functionally important in the prokaryotic oxidase, in agreement with the conclusion from previous work with the oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans [Pfitzner et al. (1998) J. Biomembr. Bioenerg. 30, 89-93]. Each of the mutants in R. sphaeroides, with an exception at only one position, is enzymatically active and pumps protons in reconstituted proteoliposomes. This includes H456A, where in the P. denitrificans oxidase a leucine residue substituted for the corresponding residue resulted in inactive enzyme. The only mutations that result in completely inactive enzyme in the set examined in the R. sphaeroides oxidase are in R52, a residue that, along with Q471, appears to be hydrogen-bonded to the formyl group of heme a in the X-ray structures. To characterize the interactions between this residue and the heme group, resonance Raman spectra of the R52 mutants were obtained. The frequency of the heme a formyl stretching mode in the R52A mutant is characteristic of that seen in non-hydrogen-bonded model heme a complexes. Thus the data confirm the presence of hydrogen bonding between the heme a formyl group and the R52 side chain, as suggested from crystallographic data. In the R52K mutant, this hydrogen bonding is maintained by the lysine residue, and this mutant enzyme retains near wild-type activity. The heme a formyl frequency is also affected by mutation of Q471, confirming the X-ray models that show this residue also has hydrogen-bonding interactions with the formyl group. Unlike R52, however, Q471 does not appear to be critical for the enzyme function.},

	Abstract = {One of the challenging features of energy-transducing terminal oxidases, like the aa3 cytochrome c oxidase of Paracoccus denitrificans, is the translocation of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane, which is coupled to the transfer of electrons to oxygen. As a prerequisite for a more advanced examination of the enzymatic properties, several amino acid residues, selected on the basis of recent three-dimensional structure determinations, were exchanged in subunit I of the Paracoccus enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis. The properties of the mutated oxidases were analyzed by different methods to elucidate whether they are involved in the coupled and coordinated transfer of protons via two different pathways either to the site of oxygen reduction or through the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic side.},

@article{Tomson:2003p10255,
	Abstract = {Two functional input pathways for protons have been characterized in the heme-copper oxidases: the D-channel and the K-channel. These two proton-conducting channels have different functional roles and have been defined both by X-ray crystallography and by the characterization of site-directed mutants. Whereas the entrance of the D-channel is well-defined as D132(I) (subunit I; Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering), the entrance of the K-channel has not been clearly defined. Previous mutagenesis studies of the cytochrome bo(3) quinol oxidase from Escherichia coli implicated an almost fully conserved glutamic acid residue within subunit II as a likely candidate for the entrance of the K-channel. The current work examines the properties of mutants of this conserved glutamate in the oxidase from R. sphaeroides (E101(II)I,A,C,Q,D,N,H) and residues in the immediate vicinity of E101(II). It is shown that virtually any substitution for E101(II), including E101(II)D, strongly reduces oxidase turnover (to 8-29%). Furthermore, the low steady-state activity correlates with an inhibition of the rate of reduction of heme a(3) prior to the reaction with O(2). These are phenotypes expected of K-channel mutants. It is concluded that the predominant entry point for protons going into the K-channel of cytochrome oxidase is the surface-exposed glutamic acid E101(II) in subunit II.},

	Abstract = {MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis.

	Abstract = {NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE. NAMD is distributed free of charge with source code at www.ks.uiuc.edu.},

CHARMM-GUI, http://www.charmm-gui.org, has been developed to provide a web-based graphical user interface to generate various input files and molecular systems to facilitate and standardize the usage of common and advanced simulation techniques in CHARMM. The web environment provides an ideal platform to build and validate a molecular model system in an interactive fashion such that, if a problem is found through visual inspection, one can go back to the previous setup and regenerate the whole system again. In this article, we describe the currently available functional modules of CHARMM-GUI Input Generator that form a basis for the advanced simulation techniques. Future directions of the CHARMM-GUI development project are also discussed briefly together with other features in the CHARMM-GUI website, such as Archive and Movie Gallery.},

	Abstract = {A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (S(CD)) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the S(CD) for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of (13)C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have become a popular and powerful technique to study lipids and membrane proteins. We present some general questions and issues that should be considered prior to embarking on molecular dynamics simulation studies of membrane proteins and review common simulation methods. We suggest a practical approach to setting up and running simulations of membrane proteins, and introduce two new (related) methods to embed a protein in a lipid bilayer. Both methods rely on placing lipids and the protein(s) on a widely spaced grid and then 'shrinking' the grid until the bilayer with the protein has the desired density, with lipids neatly packed around the protein. When starting from a grid based on a single lipid structure, or several potentially different lipid structures (method 1), the bilayer will start well-packed but requires more equilibration. When starting from a pre-equilibrated bilayer, either pure or mixed, most of the structure of the bilayer stays intact, reducing equilibration time (method 2). The main advantages of these methods are that they minimize equilibration time and can be almost completely automated, nearly eliminating one time consuming step in MD simulations of membrane proteins.},

@article{Rauscher:2011p10247,
	Abstract = {Generalized-ensemble algorithms in temperature space have become popular tools to enhance conformational sampling in biomolecular simulations. A random walk in temperature leads to a corresponding random walk in potential energy, which can be used to cross over energetic barriers and overcome the problem of quasi-nonergodicity. In this paper, we introduce two novel methods: simulated tempering distributed replica sampling (STDR) and virtual replica exchange (VREX). These methods are designed to address the practical issues inherent in the replica exchange (RE), simulated tempering (ST), and serial replica exchange (SREM) algorithms. RE requires a large, dedicated, and homogeneous cluster of CPUs to function efficiently when applied to complex systems. ST and SREM both have the drawback of requiring extensive initial simulations, possibly adaptive, for the calculation of weight factors or potential energy distribution functions. STDR and VREX alleviate the need for lengthy initial simulations, and for sync...},

@article{Rodinger:2008p4609,
	Abstract = {Distributed replica sampling [T. Rodinger et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2, 725 (2006)] is a simple and general scheme for Boltzmann sampling of conformational space by computer simulation in which multiple replicas of the system undergo a random walk in reaction coordinate or temperature space. Individual replicas are linked through a generalized Hamiltonian containing an extra potential energy term or bias which depends on the distribution of all replicas, thus enforcing the desired sampling distribution along the coordinate or parameter of interest regardless of free energy barriers. In contrast to replica exchange methods, efficient implementation of the algorithm does not require synchronicity of the individual simulations. The algorithm is inherently suited for large-scale simulations using shared or heterogeneous computing platforms such as a distributed network. In this work, we build on our original algorithm by introducing Boltzmann-weighted jumping, which allows moves of a larger magnitude and thus enhances sampling efficiency along the reaction coordinate. The approach is demonstrated using a realistic and biologically relevant application; we calculate the standard binding free energy of benzene to the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. Distributed replica sampling is used in conjunction with thermodynamic integration to compute the potential of mean force for extracting the ligand from protein and solvent along a nonphysical spatial coordinate. Dynamic treatment of the reaction coordinate leads to faster statistical convergence of the potential of mean force than a conventional static coordinate, which suffers from slow transitions on a rugged potential energy surface.},

	Abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

	Abstract = {CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983.},

	Abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solventsolvent, solventsolute, and solutesolute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein phi, chi angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome oxidase catalyzes the four-electron reduction of O2 to water and conserves the substantial free energy of the reaction in the form of a protonmotive force. For each electron, two full charges are translocated across the membrane, resulting in a voltage. One of the mechanisms to generate the charge separation in cytochrome oxidase is via a proton pump. A single reaction cycle can be monitored over the course of about 1 msec using absorption spectroscopy, revealing distinct intermediates. Thus, the reaction cycle can be studied as a series of steps. Each of the reaction steps in the catalytic cycle involves a sequence of coupled electron and proton transfer reaction, where protons are either consumed in the chemistry of water formation or pumped across the membrane. The pumping mechanism requires consideration of both the thermodynamics of the various species but also the favored kinetic pathways that assure proton pumping is unidirectional. Hence, a knowledge of transition states and transiently, poorly populated intermediates is likely to be important to understand the mechanism of the pump.},

	Abstract = {The prediction and design at the atomic level of membrane protein structures and interactions is a critical but unsolved challenge. To address this problem, we have developed an all-atom physical model that describes intraprotein and protein-solvent interactions in the membrane environment. We evaluated the ability of the model to recapitulate the energetics and structural specificities of polytopic membrane proteins by using a battery of in silico prediction and design tests. First, in side-chain packing and design tests, the model successfully predicts the side-chain conformations at 73% of nonexposed positions and the native amino acid identities at 34% of positions in naturally occurring membrane proteins. Second, the model predicts significant energy gaps between native and nonnative structures of transmembrane helical interfaces and polytopic membrane proteins. Third, distortions in transmembrane helices are successfully recapitulated in docking experiments by using fragments of ideal helices judiciously defined around helical kinks. Finally, de novo structure prediction reaches near-atomic accuracy (<2.5 A) for several small membrane protein domains (<150 residues). The success of the model highlights the critical role of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions in the stability and structural specificity of membrane protein structures and sets the stage for the high-resolution prediction and design of complex membrane protein architectures.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain that is responsible for biological energy conversion in mitochondria and aerobic bacteria. The membrane-bound enzyme converts free energy from oxygen reduction to an electrochemical proton gradient by functioning as a redox-coupled proton pump. Although the 3D structure and functional studies have revealed proton conducting pathways in the enzyme interior, the location of proton donor and acceptor groups are not fully identified. We show here by time-resolved optical and FTIR spectroscopy combined with time-resolved electrometry that some mutant enzymes incapable of proton pumping nevertheless initiate catalysis by proton transfer to a proton-loading site. A conserved tyrosine in the so-called D-channel is identified as a potential proton donor that determines the efficiency of this reaction.},

The most important systems, cytochrome c oxidase in cellular respiration and photosystem II (PSII) in photosynthesis will here be used as examples to illustrate the power of the quantum chemical tools. One main contribution from quantum chemistry is to put mechanistic suggestions onto an energy scale. Accordingly, free energy profiles can be constructed both for reduction of molecular oxygen in cytochrome c oxidase and water oxidation in PSII, including O-O bond cleavage and formation, and also proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase. For the construction of the energy diagrams, the computational results sometimes have to be combined with experimental information, such as reduction potentials and rate constants for individual steps in the reactions.},

@article{Brzezinski:2010p7795,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase is a multisubunit membrane-bound enzyme, which catalyzes oxidation of four molecules of cytochrome c(2+) and reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The electrons are taken from one side of the membrane while the protons are taken from the other side. This topographical arrangement results in a charge separation that is equivalent to moving one positive charge across the membrane for each electron transferred to O(2). In this reaction part of the free energy available from O(2) reduction is conserved in the form of an electrochemical proton gradient. In addition, part of the free energy is used to pump on average one proton across the membrane per electron transferred to O(2). Our understanding of the molecular design of the machinery that couples O(2) reduction to proton pumping in oxidases has greatly benefited from studies of so called "uncoupled" structural variants of the oxidases. In these uncoupled oxidases the catalytic O(2)-reduction reaction may display the same rates as in the wild-type CytcO, yet the electron/proton transfer to O(2) is not linked to proton pumping. One striking feature of all uncoupled variants studied to date is that the (apparent) pK(a) of a Glu residue, located deeply within a proton pathway, is either increased or decreased (from 9.4 in the wild-type oxidase). The altered pK(a) presumably reflects changes in the local structural environment of the residue and because the Glu residue is found near the catalytic site as well as near a putative exit pathway for pumped protons these changes are presumably important for controlling the rates and trajectories of the proton transfer. In this paper we summarize data obtained from studies of uncoupled structural oxidase variants and present a hypothesis that in quantitative terms offers a link between structural changes, changes in apparent pK(a) and uncoupling of proton pumping from O(2) reduction.},

	Abstract = {Bcl-2 has been shown to promote survival of cancer cells by maintaining a slight pro-oxidant state through elevated mitochondrial respiration during basal conditions. On oxidative stress, Bcl-2 moderates mitochondrial respiration through cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity to prevent an excessive buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by-production from electron transport activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of Bcl-2-mediated ROS regulation and its impact on carcinogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we show that Bcl-2 expression positively influences the targeting of nuclear-encoded COX Va and Vb to the mitochondria of cancer cells. In addition, evidence is presented in support of a protein-protein interaction between COX Va and Bcl-2, involving the BH2 domain of Bcl-2. Interestingly, episodes of serum withdrawal, glucose deprivation or hypoxia aimed at inducing early oxidative stress triggered Bcl-2-overexpressing cells to preserve mitochondrial levels of COX Va while depressing COX Vb, whereas the reverse was observed in mock-transfected cells. The unique manner in which Bcl-2 adjusted COX subunits during these physiological stress triggers had a profound impact on the resultant decrease in COX activity and maintenance of mitochondrial ROS levels, thus delineating a novel mechanism for the homeostatic role of Bcl-2 in the redox biology and metabolism of cancer cells.},

@article{Frick:2010p7751,
	Abstract = {We examined some of the potential mechanisms lungfish (Protopterus dolloi) use to regulate cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), during metabolic depression. CCO activity was reduced by 67% in isolated liver mitochondria of estivating fish. This was likely accomplished, in part, by the 46% reduction in CCO subunit I protein expression in the liver. No change in the mRNA expression levels of CCO subunits I, II, III, and IV were found in the liver, suggesting CCO is under translational regulation; however, in the kidney, messenger limitation may be a factor as the expression of subunits I and II were depressed ( approximately 10-fold) during estivation, suggesting tissue-specific mechanisms of regulation. CCO is influenced by mitochondrial membrane phospholipids, particularly cardiolipin (CL). In P. dolloi, the phospholipid composition of the liver mitochondrial membrane changed during estivation, with a approximately 2.3-fold reduction in the amount of CL. Significant positive correlations were found between CCO activity and the amount of CL and phosphatidylethanolamine within the mitochondrial membrane. It appears CCO activity is regulated through multiple mechanisms in P. dolloi, and individual subunits of CCO are regulated independently, and in a tissue-specific manner. It is proposed that altering the amount of CL within the mitochondrial membrane may be a means of regulating CCO activity during metabolical depression in the African lungfish, P. dolloi.},

@article{Ganesan:2010p8417,
	Abstract = {The K-pathway is one of the two proton-input channels required for function of cytochrome c oxidase. In the Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase, the K-channel starts at Glu101 in subunit II, which is at the surface of the protein exposed to the cytoplasm, and runs to Tyr288 at the heme a(3)/Cu(B) active site. Mutations of conserved, polar residues within the K-channel block or inhibit steady state oxidase activity. A large body of research has demonstrated that the K-channel is required to fully reduce the heme/Cu binuclear center, prior to the reaction with O(2), presumably by providing protons to stabilize the reduced metals (ferrous heme a(3) and cuprous Cu(B)). However, there are conflicting reports which raise questions about whether blocking the K-channel blocks both electrons or only one electron from reaching the heme/Cu center. In the current work, the rate and extent of the anaerobic reduction of the heme/Cu center were monitored by optical and EPR spectroscopies, comparing the wild type and mutants that block the K-channel. The new data show that when the K-channel is blocked, one electron will still readily enter the binuclear center. The one-electron reduction of the resting oxidized ("O") heme/Cu center of the K362M mutant, results in a partially reduced binuclear center in which the electron is distributed about evenly between heme a(3) and Cu(B) in the R. sphaeroides oxidase. Complete reduction of the heme/Cu center requires the uptake of two protons which must be delivered through the K-channel.},

	Abstract = {The structural and functional properties of active site mutants of cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans (PdCcO) were investigated with resonance Raman spectroscopy. Based on the Fe-CO stretching modes and low frequency heme modes, two conformers (alpha- and beta-forms) were identified that are in equilibrium in the enzyme. The alpha-conformer, which is the dominant species in the wild-type enzyme, has a shorter heme a(3) iron-Cu(B) distance and a more distorted heme, as compared to the beta-conformer, which has a more relaxed and open distal pocket. In general, the mutations caused a decrease in the population of the alpha-conformer, which is concomitant with a decreased in the catalytic activity, indicating that the alpha-conformer is the active form of the enzyme. The data suggest that the native structure of the enzyme is in a delicate balance of intramolecular interactions. We present a model in which the mutations destabilize the alpha-conformer, with respect to the beta-conformer, and raise the activation barrier for the inter-conversion between the two conformers. The accessibility of the two conformers in the conformational space of CcO plausibly plays a critical role in coupling the redox reaction to proton translocation during the catalytic cycle of the enzyme.},

@article{Kim:2009p5654,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, reduces oxygen to water and uses the released energy to pump protons across a membrane. Here, we use kinetic master equations to explore the energetic and kinetic control of proton pumping in CcO. We construct models consistent with thermodynamic principles, the structure of CcO, experimentally known proton affinities, and equilibrium constants of intermediate reactions. The resulting models are found to capture key properties of CcO, including the midpoint redox potentials of the metal centers and the electron transfer rates. We find that coarse-grained models with two proton sites and one electron site can pump one proton per electron against membrane potentials exceeding 100 mV. The high pumping efficiency of these models requires strong electrostatic couplings between the proton loading (pump) site and the electron site (heme a), and kinetic gating of the internal proton transfer. Gating is achieved by enhancing the rate of proton transfer from the conserved Glu-242 to the pump site on reduction of heme a, consistent with the predictions of the water-gated model of proton pumping. The model also accounts for the phenotype of D-channel mutations associated with loss of pumping but retained turnover. The fundamental mechanism identified here for the efficient conversion of chemical energy into an electrochemical potential should prove relevant also for other molecular machines and novel fuel-cell designs.},

@article{Mobley:2009p4198,
	Abstract = {We review insights from computational studies of affinities of ligands binding to proteins. The power of structural biology is in translating knowledge of protein structures into insights about their forces, binding, and mechanisms. However, the complementary power of computer modeling is in showing "the rest of the story" (i.e., how motions and ensembles and alternative conformers and the entropies and forces that cannot be seen in single molecular structures also contribute to binding affinities). Upon binding to a protein, a ligand can bind in multiple orientations; the protein or ligand can be deformed by the binding event; waters, ions, or cofactors can have unexpected involvement; and conformational or solvation entropies can sometimes play large and otherwise unpredictable roles. Computer modeling is helping to elucidate these factors.},

	Abstract = {This review describes the recent knowledge about tightly bound lipids in membrane protein structures and deduces general principles of the binding interactions. Bound lipids are grouped in annular, nonannular, and integral protein lipids. The importance of lipid binding for vertical positioning and tight integration of proteins in the membrane, for assembly and stabilization of oligomeric and multisubunit complexes, for supercomplexes, as well as their functional roles are pointed out. Lipid binding is stabilized by multiple noncovalent interactions from protein residues to lipid head groups and hydrophobic tails. Based on analysis of lipids with refined head groups in membrane protein structures, distinct motifs were identified for stabilizing interactions between the phosphodiester moieties and side chains of amino acid residues. Differences between binding at the electropositive and electronegative membrane side, as well as a preferential binding to the latter, are observed. A first attempt to identify lipid head group specific binding motifs is made. A newly identified cardiolipin binding site in the yeast cytochrome bc(1) complex is described. Assignment of unsaturated lipid chains and evolutionary aspects of lipid binding are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Gasomodulators - nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulphide - are important physiological mediators that have been implicated in disorders such as neurodegeneration and sepsis. Some of their biological functions involve the mitochondria. In particular, their inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase has received much attention as this can cause energy depletion and cytotoxicity. However, reports that cellular energy production and cell survival are maintained even in the presence of gasomodulators are not uncommon. In both cases, modulation of mitochondrial targets by the gasomodulators appears to be an important event. We provide an overview of the effects of the gasomodulators on the mitochondria.},

A crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme reveals, as predicted, deoxycholate bound with its carboxyl group at the entrance of the K path. Since cholate is a known potent inhibitor of bovine oxidase and is seen in a similar position in the bovine structure, the crystallographically defined, conserved steroid binding site could reveal a regulatory site for steroids or structurally related molecules that act on the essential K proton path.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) transfers protons from the inner surface of the enzyme to the buried O2 reduction site through two different pathways, termed K and D, and from the outer surface via an undefined route. These proton paths can be inhibited by metals such as zinc or cadmium, but the sites of inhibition have not been established. Anomalous difference Fourier analyses of Rhodobacter sphaeroides CcO crystals, with cadmium added, reveal metal binding sites that include the proposed initial proton donor/acceptor of the K pathway, Glu-101 of subunit II. Mutant forms of CcO that lack Glu-101II (E101A and E101A/H96A) exhibit low activity and eliminate metal binding at this site. Significant activity is restored to E101A and E101A/H96A by adding the lipophilic carboxylic compounds, arachidonic acid and cholic acid, but not by their non-carboxylic analogues. These amphipathic acids likely provide their carboxylic groups as substitute proton donors/acceptors in the absence of Glu-101II, as previously observed for arachidonic acid in mutants that alter Asp-132I of the D pathway. The activity of E101A/H96A is still inhibited by zinc, but this remaining inhibition is nearly eliminated by removal of subunit III, which is known to alter the D pathway. The results identify the Glu-101/His-96 site of subunit II as the site of metal binding that inhibits the uptake of protons into the K pathway and indicate that subunit III contributes to zinc binding and/or inhibition of the D pathway. By removing subunit III from E101A/H96A, thereby eliminating zinc inhibition of the uptake of protons from the inner surface of CcO, we confirm that an external zinc binding site is involved in inhibiting the backflow of protons to the active site.},

@article{Qin:2009p5745,
	Abstract = {A role for conformational change in the coupling mechanism of cytochrome c oxidase is the subject of controversy. Relatively small conformational changes have been reported in comparisons of reduced and oxidized crystal structures of bovine oxidase but none in bacterial oxidases. Comparing the X-ray crystal structures of the reduced (at 2.15 A resolution) and oxidized forms of cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, we observe a displacement of heme a(3) involving both the porphyrin ring and the hydroxyl farnesyl tail, accompanied by protein movements in nearby regions, including the mid part of helix VIII of subunit I which harbors key residues of the K proton uptake path, K362 and T359. The conformational changes in the reduced form are reversible upon reoxidation. They result in an opening of the top of the K pathway and more ordered waters being resolved in that region, suggesting an access path for protons into the active site. In all high-resolution structures of oxidized R. sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase, a water molecule is observed in the hydrophobic region above the top of the D path, strategically positioned to facilitate the connection of residue E286 of subunit I to the active site or to the proton pumping exit path. In the reduced and reduced plus cyanide structures, this water molecule disappears, implying disruption of proton conduction from the D path under conditions when the K path is open, thus providing a mechanism for alternating access to the active site.},

	Abstract = {Pharmacogenetic studies in mood disorders are rapidly proliferating after the initial reports linking gene variants to treatment outcomes. However, a considerable range of methodologies has been used, making it difficult to compare results across studies and limiting the representativeness of findings. Specification of sampling source (inpatients vs outpatients, primary vs tertiary settings), standardization of diagnostic systems and treatments, adequate monitoring of compliance through plasma levels, sufficient length of observation (at least 6 weeks for acute antidepressant treatments, though 3-6 months are preferable), the use of a range of response criteria and the inclusion of possible environmental confounding variables (life events, social support, temperament) are all potentially important issues when planning pharmacogenetic studies. We reviewed the state-of-the-art methodology and suggested possible guideline for future studies.},

	Abstract = {We propose a simple model of cytochrome c oxidase, including four redox centers and four protonable sites, to study the time evolution of electrostatically coupled electron and proton transfers initiated by the injection of a single electron into the enzyme. We derive a system of master equations for electron and proton state probabilities and show that an efficient pumping of protons across the membrane can be obtained for a reasonable set of parameters. All four experimentally observed kinetic phases appear naturally from our model. We also calculate the dependence of the pumping efficiency on the transmembrane voltage at different temperatures and discuss a possible mechanism of the redox-driven proton translocation.},

	Abstract = {We have examined the network of connected internal cavities in cytochrome c oxidase along which water produced at the catalytic center is removed from the enzyme. Using combination of structural analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy calculations we have identified two exit pathways that connect the Mg2+ ion cavity to the outside of the enzyme. Each pathway has a well-defined bottleneck, which determines the overall rate of water traffic along the exit pathway, and a specific cooperative mechanism of passing it. One of the pathways is going via Arg438/439 (in bovine numbering) toward the CuA center, approaching closely its His204B ligand and Lys171B residue; and the other is going toward Asp364 and Thr294. Comparison of the pathways among different aa3-type enzymes shows that they are well conserved. Possible connections of the finding to redox-coupled proton pumping mechanism are discussed. We propose specific mutations near the bottlenecks of the exit pathways that can test some of our hypotheses.},

@article{Takano:2010p7750,
	Abstract = {The electronic structures of heme a of cytochrome c oxidase in the redox states were studied, using hybrid density functional theory with a polarizable continuum model and a point charge model. We found that the most stable electronic configurations of the d electrons of the Fe ion are determined by the orbital interactions of the d orbitals of the Fe ion with the pi orbitals of the porphyrin ring and the His residues. The redox reaction of the Fe ion influences the charge density on the formyl group through the pi conjugation of the porphyrin ring. In addition, we found the charge transfer from the Fe ion to the propionate group of heme a in the redox change despite the lack of the pi-conjugation. We elucidated that the charge propagation originates from the heme a structure itself and that the origin of the charge delocalization to the heme propionate is the orbital interactions between the d orbital of the Fe ion and the p orbitals of the carboxylate part of the heme propionate via the pi conjugation of the porphyrin ring and the sigma* orbital of the C-C bond of the propionate group. The electrostatic effect by surrounding proteins enhances the charge transfer from the Fe ion to the propionate group. These results indicate that heme propionate groups serve electron mediators in electron transfer as well as electrostatic anchors, and that proteins surrounding the active site reinforce the congenital abilities of the cofactors.},

	Abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced nausea can be severe enough to lead to early treatment discontinuation. However, it is currently not possible to predict the occurrence of nausea before the initiation of SSRI treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of genetic polymorphisms in the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2A, 3A, and 3B (5-HT3B) receptors, 5-HT transporter, and CYP2D6 genes on the incidence of paroxetine-induced nausea. A consecutive series of 72 Japanese patients with depressive or anxiety disorders were treated with paroxetine. Paroxetine-induced nausea was assessed by a pharmacist and was observed in 29.2% of the patients. A significant (nominal p=0.00286) association was found between the incidence of nausea and the -100_-102AAG insertion/deletion polymorphism of the 5-HT3B receptor gene. No significant associations were observed between the other genetic polymorphisms and the incidence of nausea. The -100_-102AAG deletion variant of the 5-HT3B receptor gene may affect paroxetine-induced nausea.},

	Abstract = {Shewanella oneidensis is an important model organism for bioremediation studies because of its diverse respiratory capabilities, conferred in part by multicomponent, branched electron transport systems. Here we report the sequencing of the S. oneidensis genome, which consists of a 4,969,803-base pair circular chromosome with 4,758 predicted protein-encoding open reading frames (CDS) and a 161,613-base pair plasmid with 173 CDSs. We identified the first Shewanella lambda-like phage, providing a potential tool for further genome engineering. Genome analysis revealed 39 c-type cytochromes, including 32 previously unidentified in S. oneidensis, and a novel periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase, which are integral members of the electron transport system. This genome sequence represents a critical step in the elucidation of the pathways for reduction (and bioremediation) of pollutants such as uranium (U) and chromium (Cr), and offers a starting point for defining this organism's complex electron transport systems and metal ion-reducing capabilities.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial membranes are unique in many ways. Unlike other cellular membranes, they are comprised of two membranes instead of just one, and cardiolipins, one of the abundant lipid species in mitochondrial membranes, are not found in significant amounts elsewhere in the cell. Among other aspects, the exceptional nature of cardiolipins is characterized by their small charged head group connected to typically four hydrocarbon chains. In this work, we present atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the inner mitochondrial membrane modeled as a mixture of cardiolipins (CLs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). For comparison, we also consider pure one-component bilayers and mixed PC-PE, PC-CL, and PE-CL membranes. We find that the influence of CLs on membrane properties depends strongly on membrane composition. This is highlighted by studies of the stability of CL-containing membranes, which indicate that the interactions of CL in ternary lipid bilayers cannot be deduced from the corresponding ones in binary membranes. Moreover, while the membrane properties in the hydrocarbon region are only weakly affected by CLs, the changes at the membrane-water interface turn out to be prominent. The effects at the interface are most evident in membrane properties related to hydrogen bonding and the binding phenomena associated with electrostatic interactions.},

@article{Stafford:2010p8548,
	Abstract = {Tumors frequently contain somatic mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Whether these mutations have a causal function or are merely an effect is still unclear. As tumor formation is a type of somatic evolution, we examine the cancer mutation pattern for consistency with random forces or selection. We also compare the tumor mutation pattern to that observed in the population to gain insight on the mutation process in cancer. Among germline mtDNAs, all genes show strong deficiency in missense changes, reflecting negative selection during human history. In somatic cancer sequences, mtDNA genes show relaxed negative selection relative to germline, or mutation consistent with neutrality. NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 L in particular show cancer missense mutation rates 9-18 times that of germline. Bootstrap analysis shows cytochrome B to have cancer changes in positions of unusually high conservation, suggesting that tumors select for mutations in residues of high functionality. Strong negative selection was detected in mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase 1 (MTCO1), suggesting that tumor cells are dependent upon MTCO1 function. Common population polymorphisms were also frequently reported among somatic tumor mutations. The implication of these 'somatic polymorphisms' in tumor growth is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The structure and O2-reactivity of copper(I) complexes supported by novel ligands, Pye2 (1,3,5-triethyl-2,4-bis((N-benzyl-N-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)-)aminomethyl)benzene), Pye3 (1,3,5-triethyl-2,4,6-tris((N-benzyl-N-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl))aminomethyl)benzene), MePym2 (1,3,5-triethyl-2,4-bis((N-benzyl-N-(6-methylpyridin-2-ylmethyl))aminomethyl)benzene), and MePym3 (1,3,5-triethyl-2,4,6-tris((N-benzyl-N-(6-methylpyridin-2-ylmethyl))aminomethyl)benzene) have been examined. The ligands are designed to construct mono-, di-, and trinuclear copper(I) complexes by connecting two or three pyridylalkylamine metal-binding sites to a 1,3,5-triethylbenzene spacer. Thus, the reaction of the ligands with [CuI(CH3CN)4]X (X = PF6, CF3SO3) or CuICl gave the expected mononuclear copper(I) complexes [CuI(Pye2)(CF3SO3)] (1) and [CuI(Pye3)](CF3SO3) (2), dinuclear copper(I) complex [CuI2(MePym2)(Cl)]CuICl2 (3), and trinuclear copper(I) complex [CuI3(MePym3)(CH3CN)3](CF3SO3)3 (4), the structures of which were determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The mononuclear copper(I) complexes, 1 and 2, exhibit a distorted three-coordinate T-shape structure and a trigonal planar structure, respectively, which are very close to the coordination geometry of the CuA site of PHM (peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase) and the CuB site of CcO (cytochrome c oxidase). Notably, 1 and 2 showed a significantly high oxidation potential (990 mV vs SCE), thus showing virtually no reactivity toward O2. On the other hand, the metal centers of the dinuclear and trinuclear copper(I) complexes, 3 and 4, exhibit a distorted trigonal planar geometry and a trigonal pyramidal geometry, respectively. In contrast to the mononuclear copper(I) complexes, these dinuclear and trinuclear copper(I) complexes reacted with O2 to induce an aromatic ligand hydroxylation reaction involving an NIH-shift of one of the ethyl substituents on the benzene spacer. The NIH-shift of the alkyl substituent on the aromatic ring is strong evidence of the electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism, although the active oxygen intermediate could not be directly detected during the course of the reaction. The biological relevance of the copper(I) complexes is also discussed on the basis of structure and O2-reactivity.},

	Abstract = {We have studied a charge-insertion process that models the deprotonation of a histidine side chain in the active site of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) using both the continuum electrostatic calculations and the microscopic simulations. The group of interest is a ligand to Cu(B) center of CcO, which has been previously suggested to play the role of the proton pumping element in the enzyme; the group is located near a large internal water cavity in the protein. Using the nonpolarizable Amber-99 force field in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have calculated the nuclear part of the reaction-field energy of charging of the His group and combined it with the electronic part, which we estimated in terms of the electronic continuum (EC) model, to obtain the total reaction-field energy of charging. The total free energy obtained in this MDEC approach was then compared with that calculated using pure continuum electrostatic model with variable dielectric parameters. The dielectric constant for the "dry" protein and that of the internal water cavity of CcO were determined as those parameters that provide best agreement between the continuum and microscopic MDEC model. The nuclear (MD) polarization alone (without electronic part) of a dry protein was found to correspond to an unphysically low dielectric constant of only about 1.3, whereas the inclusion of electronic polarizability increases the protein dielectric constant to 2.6-2.8. A detailed analysis is presented as to how the protein structure should be selected for the continuum calculations, as well as which probe and atomic radii should be used for cavity definition. The dielectric constant of the internal water cavity was found to be 80 or even higher using "standard" parameters of water probe radius, 1.4 A, and protein atomic radii from the MD force field for cavity description; such high values are ascribed to the fact that the standard procedure produces unphysically small cavities. Using x-ray data for internal water in CcO, we have explored optimization of the parameters and the algorithm of cavity description. For Amber radii, the optimal probe size was found to be 1.25 A; the dielectric of water cavity in this case is in the range of 10-16. The most satisfactory cavity description, however, was achieved with ProtOr atomic radii, while keeping the probe radius to be standard 1.4 A. In this case, the value of cavity dielectric constant was found to be in the range of 3-6. The obtained results are discussed in the context of recent calculations and experimental measurements of dielectric properties of proteins.},

@article{Branden:2006p9874,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain and couples energetically the reduction of oxygen to water to proton pumping across the membrane. The results from previous studies showed that proton pumping can be uncoupled from the O2-reduction reaction by replacement of one single residue, Asn-139 by Asp (N139D), located approximately 30 A from the catalytic site, in the D-proton pathway. The uncoupling was correlated with an increase in the pK(a) of an internal proton donor, Glu-286, from approximately 9.4 to >11. Here, we show that replacement of the acidic residue, Asp-132 by Asn in the N139D CcO (D132N/N139D double-mutant CcO) results in restoration of the Glu-286 pK(a) to the original value and recoupling of the proton pump during steady-state turnover. Furthermore, a kinetic investigation of the specific reaction steps in the D132N/N139D double-mutant CcO showed that proton pumping is sustained even if proton uptake from solution, through the D-pathway, is slowed. However, during single-turnover oxidation of the fully reduced CcO the P --> F transition, which does not involve electron transfer to the catalytic site, was not coupled to proton pumping. The results provide insights into the mechanism of proton pumping by CcO and the structural elements involved in this process.},

Among others, the following phenomena are discussed: interactions of interfacially adsorbed peptides, pore-forming amphipathic peptides, adsorption of charged proteins onto oppositely charged lipid membranes, lipid-induced tilting of proteins embedded in lipid bilayers, protein-induced bilayer deformations, protein insertion and assembly, and lipid-controlled functioning of membrane proteins.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, the mechanism of proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase is examined. Data on cooperative linkage of vectorial proton translocation to oxido-reduction of Cu(A) and heme a in the CO-inhibited, liposome-reconstituted bovine cytochrome c oxidase are reviewed. Results on proton translocation associated to single-turnover oxido-reduction of the four metal centers in the unliganded, membrane-reconstituted oxidase are also presented. On the basis of these results, X-ray crystallographic structures and spectrometric data for a proton pumping model in cytochrome c oxidase is proposed. This model, which is specifically derived from data available for the bovine cytochrome c oxidase, is intended to illustrate the essential features of cooperative coupling of proton translocation at the low potential redox site. Variants will have to be introduced for those members of the heme copper oxidase family which differ in the redox components of the low potential site and in the amino acid network connected to this site. The model we present describes in detail steps of cooperative coupling of proton pumping at the low potential Cu(A)-heme a site in the bovine enzyme. It is then outlined how this cooperative proton transfer can be thermodynamically and kinetically coupled to the chemistry of oxygen reduction to water at the high potential Cu(B)-heme a(3) center, so as to result in proton pumping, in the turning-over enzyme, against a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient of some 250 mV.},

	Abstract = {Protons are transferred from the inner surface of cytochrome c oxidase to the active site by the D and K pathways, as well as from the D pathway to the outer surface by a largely undefined proton exit route. Alteration of the initial proton acceptor of the D pathway, D132, to alanine has previously been shown to greatly inhibit oxidase turnover and slow proton uptake into the D pathway. Here it is shown that the removal of subunit III restores a substantial rate of O(2) reduction to D132A. Presumably an alternative proton acceptor for the D pathway becomes active in the absence of subunit III and D132. Thus, in the absence of subunit III cytochrome oxidase shows greater flexibility in terms of proton entry into the D pathway. In the presence of DeltaPsi and DeltapH, turnover of the wild-type oxidase or D132A is slower in the absence of subunit III. Comparison of the turnover rates of subunit III-depleted wild-type oxidase to those of the zinc-inhibited wild-type oxidase containing subunit III, both reconstituted into vesicles, leads to the hypothesis that the absence of subunit III inhibits the ability of the normal proton exit pathway to take up protons from the outside in the presence of DeltaPsi and DeltapH. Thus, subunit III appears to affect the transfer of protons from both the inner and outer surfaces of cytochrome oxidase, perhaps accounting for the long-observed lower efficiency of proton pumping by the subunit III-depleted oxidase.},

@article{Namslauer:2010p9850,
	Abstract = {In this work we have investigated the effect of a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation found in human colon cells, at a functional-molecular level. The mutation results in the amino-acid substitution Tyr19His in subunit I of the human CytcO and it is associated with respiratory deficiency. It was introduced into Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which carries a cytochrome c oxidase (cytochrome aa(3)) that serves as a model of the mitochondrial counterpart. The residue is situated in the middle of a pathway that is used to transfer substrate protons as well as protons that are pumped across the membrane. The Tyr33His (equivalent residue in the bacterial CytcO) structural variant of the enzyme was purified and its function was investigated. The results show that in the structurally altered CytcO the activity decreased due to slowed proton transfer; proton transfer from an internal proton donor, the highly-conserved Glu286, to the catalytic site was slowed by a factor of approximately 5, while reprotonation of the Glu from solution was slowed by a factor of approximately 40. In addition, in the structural variant proton pumping was completely impaired. These results are explained in terms of introduction of a barrier for proton transfer through the D pathway and changes in the coordination of water molecules surrounding the Glu286 residue. The study offers an explanation, at the molecular level, to the link between a specific amino-acid substitution and a pathogenic phenotype identified in human colon cells.},

@article{Lepp:2008p9859,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase couples electron transfer from cytochrome c to O 2 to proton pumping across the membrane. In the initial part of the reaction of the reduced cytochrome c oxidase with O 2, an electron is transferred from heme a to the catalytic site, parallel to the membrane surface. Even though this electron transfer is not linked to proton uptake from solution, recently Belevich et al. [(2006) Nature 440, 829] showed that it is linked to transfer of charge perpendicular to the membrane surface (electrogenic reaction). This electrogenic reaction was attributed to internal transfer of a proton from Glu286, in the D proton pathway, to an unidentified protonatable site "above" the heme groups. The proton transfer was proposed to initiate the sequence of events leading to proton pumping. In this study, we have investigated electrogenic reactions in structural variants of cytochrome c oxidase in which residues in the second, K proton pathway of cytochrome c oxidase were modified. The results indicate that the electrogenic reaction linked to electron transfer to the catalytic site originates from charge transfer within the K pathway, which presumably facilitates reduction of the site.},

Of 3606 amino acid residues in the dimer, 3560 have been converged to a reasonable structure by refinement. A hydrogen-bonded system, including a propionate of a heme A (heme a), part of peptide backbone, and an imidazole ligand of CuA, could provide an electron transfer pathway between CuA and heme a. Two possible proton pathways for pumping, each spanning from the matrix to the cytosolic surfaces, were identified, including hydrogen bonds, internal cavities likely to contain water molecules, and structures that could form hydrogen bonds with small possible conformational change of amino acid side chains. Possible channels for chemical protons to produce H2O, for removing the produced water, and for O2, respectively, were identified.},

	Abstract = {Like many voltage-sensitive ion pumps, cytochrome c oxidase is inhibited by zinc. Binding of zinc to the outside surface of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase inhibits the enzyme with a K(I) of < or = 5 microm when the enzyme is reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles in the presence of a membrane potential. In the absence of a membrane potential and a pH gradient, millimolar concentrations of zinc are required to inhibit. This differential inhibition causes a dramatic increase in the respiratory control ratio from 6 to 40 for wild-type oxidase. The external zinc inhibition is removed by EDTA and is not competitive with cytochrome c binding but is competitive with protons. Only Cd(2+) of the many metals tested (Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Ca(2+), Ba(2+), Li(2+), Cs(2+), Hg(2+), Ni(2+), Co(2+), Cu(2+) Tb(3+), Tm(3+)) showed inhibitory effects similar to Zn(2+). Proton pumping is slower and less efficient with zinc. The results suggest that zinc inhibits proton movement through a proton exit path, which can allow proton back-leak at high membrane potentials. The physiological and mechanistic significance of proton movement in the exit pathway and its blockage by zinc is discussed in terms of regulation of the efficiency of energy transduction.},

	Abstract = {Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium capable of using soluble and insoluble forms of manganese [Mn(III/IV)] and iron [Fe(III)] as terminal electron acceptors during anaerobic respiration. To assess the structural association of two outer membrane-associated c-type decaheme cytochromes (i.e., OmcA [SO1779] and MtrC [SO1778]) and their ability to reduce soluble Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), we expressed these proteins with a C-terminal tag in wild-type S. oneidensis and a mutant deficient in these genes (i.e., Delta omcA mtrC). Endogenous MtrC copurified with tagged OmcA in wild-type Shewanella, suggesting a direct association. To further evaluate their possible interaction, both proteins were purified to near homogeneity following the independent expression of OmcA and MtrC in the Delta omcA mtrC mutant. Each purified cytochrome was confirmed to contain 10 hemes and exhibited Fe(III)-NTA reductase activity. To measure binding, MtrC was labeled with the multiuse affinity probe 4',5'-bis(1,3,2-dithioarsolan-2-yl)fluorescein (1,2-ethanedithiol)2, which specifically associates with a tetracysteine motif engineered at the C terminus of MtrC. Upon titration with OmcA, there was a marked increase in fluorescence polarization indicating the formation of a high-affinity protein complex (Kd < 500 nM) between MtrC and OmcA whose binding was sensitive to changes in ionic strength. Following association, the OmcA-MtrC complex was observed to have enhanced Fe(III)-NTA reductase specific activity relative to either protein alone, demonstrating that OmcA and MtrC can interact directly with each other to form a stable complex that is consistent with their role in the electron transport pathway of S. oneidensis MR-1.},

@article{Zhu:2010p8237,
	Abstract = {The aa(3)-type cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides utilizes two proton-input channels to provide all the protons for chemistry (water formation) and proton pumping. The D-channel is responsible for the uptake of all pumped protons, four protons per O(2). Several substitutions of either N139 or N207, near the entrance of the D-channel, were previously reported to decouple the proton pump from oxidase activity. In this work, the characteristics of additional mutations in this region of the protein (N139, N207, N121, and S142) are determined to elucidate the mechanism of decoupling. With the exception of the substitution of a large, hydrophobic residue (N139L), all the mutations of N139 resulted in an enzyme with high oxidase activity but with a severely diminished proton pumping stoichiometry. Whereas N207D was previously shown to be decoupled, N207A and N207T exhibit nearly wild-type behavior. The new data display a pattern. Small, nonionizable substitutions of N139 or N121 result in decoupling of the proton pump but maintain high turnover rates. These residues are directly hydrogen bonded to two water molecules (Water6574 and Water6584) that are part of the single-file chain of water molecules within the D-channel leading to E286 at the top of the channel. The data suggest that the integrity of this water chain within the D-channel is critical for rapid proton transfer. The mechanism of decoupling is most likely due to the slowing of the rate of proton delivery below a threshold that is required for protonation of the putative proton loading site. Protons delivered outside this time window are delivered to the active site where they are consumed in the formation of water. The rate of proton delivery required to protonate the pump site must be significantly faster than the rate of delivery of protons to the catalytic site. For this reason, mutations can result in decoupling of the proton pump without slowing the catalytic turnover by the enzyme.},

@article{Zhang:2010p8547,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) reduces O(2) to water via a series of proton-coupled electron transfers, generating a transmembrane electrochemical gradient. Coupling electron and proton transfer requires changing the pK(a) values of buried residues at each stage in the reaction cycle. Heme a is a key cofactor in the CcO electron transfer chain. Mutation of Ser44 to Asp has been reported [Mills, D. A., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 11499-11509], changing the hydrogen bond acceptor from His102, the heme a axial ligand in Rhodobactor sphaeroides CcO. This adds an acidic residue to the CcO interior. The electrochemical behavior of heme a in wild-type and S44D CcO is compared using the continuum electrostatics program MCCE. The introduced, deeply buried Asp remains ionized at physiological pH only when the nearby heme is oxidized. Heme a reduction is now calculated to be strongly coupled to Asp proton binding, while with Ser44, it is weakly coupled to small protonation shifts at multiple sites, increasing the pH dependence in the mutant. At pH 7, the partially ionized Asp 44 is calculated to lower the heme redox potential by 50 mV as expected given the thermodynamics of coupled electron and proton transfers. This highlights an curious finding in the experimental results where a low Asp pK(a) is found together with a stabilized reduced heme. The stabilization of a heme oxidation in a model complex by a hydrogen bond to the axial His ligand calculated with continuum electrostatics and with density functional theory were in good agreement.},

	Abstract = {In order to illustrate how theory and experiments can be combined, examples are taken from two projects that have been going on for a decade. The goal is to obtain the full mechanistic picture of water oxidation in photosystem II and proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase. It is argued that for obtaining a complete description of these processes, both experiments and theoretical calculations are needed. It is obvious that there are aspects, which are out of reach for computations, but there are also key aspects that can not be obtained by experiments. This concerns very short-lived species but also, in the case of photosynthesis in particular, structural information that is presently out of reach. The main contributions from theory in the present cases, is for photosynthesis a mechanism for O-O bond formation including new and improved structures for all S-states, and for proton pumping a plausible and simple mechanism for proton gating. The examples also illustrate that sometimes rather qualitative experimental information can be of highest importance.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (CytcO) is a redox-driven proton pump in the respiratory chain of mitochondria and many aerobic bacteria. The results from several studies have shown that zinc ions interfere with both the uptake and release of protons, presumably by binding near the orifice of the proton entrance and exit pathways. To elucidate the effect of Zn2+ binding on individual electron and proton-transfer reactions, in this study, we have investigated the reaction of the fully reduced R. sphaeroides CytcO with O2, both with enzyme in detergent solution and reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles, and, with and without, Zn2+. The results show that addition of Zn2+ at concentrations of < or = 250 microM to the outside of the vesicles did not alter the transition rates between intermediates PR (P3)-->F3-->O4. However, proton pumping was impaired specifically during the P3-->F3, but not during the F3-->O4 transition at Zn2+ concentrations of < or = 25 microM. Furthermore, proton pumping during the P3-->F3 transition was typically impaired with the "as isolated" CytcO, which was found to contain Zn2+ ions at microM concentration. As has already been shown, Zn2+ was also found to obstruct proton uptake during the P3-->F3 transition, presumably by binding to a site near the orifice of the D-pathway. In this work we found a KI of approximately 1 microM for this binding site. In conclusion, the results show that Zn2+ ions bind on both sides of CytcO and that binding of Zn2+ at the proton output side selectively impairs proton release during the P3-->F3 transition.},

	Abstract = {We describe the adaptation of the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method for prediction of helical transmembrane protein structures. The membrane environment is modeled by embedding the protein chain into a model membrane represented by parallel planes defining hydrophobic, interface, and polar membrane layers for each energy evaluation. The optimal embedding is determined by maximizing the exposure of surface hydrophobic residues within the membrane and minimizing hydrophobic exposure outside of the membrane. Protein conformations are built up using the Rosetta fragment assembly method and evaluated using a new membrane-specific version of the Rosetta low-resolution energy function in which residue-residue and residue-environment interactions are functions of the membrane layer in addition to amino acid identity, distance, and density. We find that lower energy and more native-like structures are achieved by sequential addition of helices to a growing chain, which may mimic some aspects of helical protein biogenesis after translocation, rather than folding the whole chain simultaneously as in the Rosetta soluble protein prediction method. In tests on 12 membrane proteins for which the structure is known, between 51 and 145 residues were predicted with root-mean-square deviation <4 A from the native structure.},

	Abstract = {Specific interactions between lipids and membrane proteins have been observed in recent high-resolution crystal structures of membrane proteins. A number of cytochrome oxidase structures were analyzed, along with many amino acid sequences of membrane-spanning regions aligned according to their location in the membrane. The results reveal conservation of lipid-binding sites and of the residues that form them. These studies imply that bound lipids have important roles that are crucial to the assembly, structure, or activity of the protein. Evidence for some of these roles in subunit interactions, membrane insertion, and protein-protein complex formation is reviewed.},

@article{Frey:1990p6924,
	Abstract = {The synthetic 25-residue signal peptide of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV was labelled with the fluorophor 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) at its single cysteine residue. Addition of small unilamellar vesicles of 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) to the labelled peptide resulted in a shift of the NBD excitation and emission spectra to shorter wavelengths. Binding of the peptide to the vesicles was measured by the increase in the fluorescence emission yield. A surface partition constant of (3.9 +/- 0.5) x 10(3) M-1 was derived from these titrations. When the membrane contained, in addition to POPC, negatively charged 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), the NBD fluorescence spectra were further shifted to shorter wavelengths and exhibited increased quantum yields. The apparent partition constants were increased to 10(4)-10(5) M-1 for vesicles with 20 or 100 mol% POPG. Lateral diffusion of the peptide was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in multibilayers of POPC, POPG, POPC/POPG (4:1) and 1,2-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine. The lateral diffusion coefficients of the peptide in bilayers of POPC (8 x 10(-8) cm2/s at 21 degrees C) were 1.5-1.6-fold greater than those of NBD-labelled phospholipids (5 x 10(-8) cm2/s at 21 degrees C), but 1.5-1.8-fold smaller (3 x 10(-8) cm2/s in 20% POPG and at 21 degrees C) than the lipid diffusion coefficients in the negatively charged bilayers. It is concluded that the signal peptide associates with phospholipid bilayers in two different forms, which depend on the lipid charge. The experiments with POPC bilayers are well explained by a model in which the peptide partitions into the region of the phospholipid head-groups and diffuses along the membrane/water interface. If POPG is present in the membrane, electrostatic attractions between the basic residues of the peptide and the acidic lipid head-groups result in a deeper penetration of the bilayer. For this case, two models that are both consistent with the experimental data are discussed, in which the peptide either forms an oligomer of three to six partially helical membrane-spanning monomers, or inserts into the bilayer with its amphiphilic helical segment aligned parallel to the plane of the membrane and located near the head-group and outer hydrocarbon region of the bilayer.},

	Abstract = {As stringent tests for the molecular model and computational protocol, microscopic pK(a) calculations are performed for the key residue, Glu286, in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) using a combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential and a thermodynamic integration protocol. The impact of the number of water molecules in the hydrophobic cavity and protonation state of several key residues (e.g., His334, Cu(B)-bound water, and PRD(a3)) on the computed microscopic pK(a) values of Glu286 has been systematically examined. To help evaluate the systematic errors in the QM/MM-based protocol, microscopic pK(a) calculations have also been carried out for sites in a soluble protein (Asp70 in T4 lysozyme) and a better-characterized membrane protein (Asp85 in bacteriorhodopsin). Overall, the results show a significant degree of internal consistency and reproducibility that support the effectiveness of the computational framework. Although the number of water molecules in the hydrophobic cavity does not greatly influence the computed pK(a) of Glu286, the protonation states of several residues, some of which are rather far away, have more significant impacts. Adopting the standard protonation state for all titratable residues leaves a large net charge on the system and a significantly elevated pK(a) for Glu286, highlighting that any attempt to address the energetics of proton transfers in CcO at a microscopic level should carefully select the protonation state of residues, even those not in the immediate neighborhood of the active site. The calculations indirectly argue against the deprotonation of His334 for the proton pumping process, although further studies that explicitly compute its pK(a) are required for a more conclusive statement. Finally, the deprotonated Glu286 is found to be in a stable water-mediated connection with PRD(a3) for at least several nanoseconds when this presumed pumping site is protonated. This does not support the proposed role of Glu286 as a robust gating valve that prevents proton leakage, although a conclusive statement awaits a more elaborate characterization of the Glu286-PRD(a3) connectivity with free energy simulations and a protonated PRD(a3). The large sets of microscopic simulations performed here have provided useful guidance to the establishment of a meaningful molecular model and effective computational protocol for explicitly analyzing the proton transfer kinetics in CcO, which is required for answering key questions regarding the pumping function of this fascinating and complex system.},

	Abstract = {In the visible/NIR (600-900 nm) three different redox centres are potentially detectable in vivo in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase: haem a (605nm), the binuclear haem a3/CuB centre (655 nm) and CuA (830 nm). In this paper we report changes in the steady state reduction of these centres following increases in the rate of electron entry into the purified enzyme complex under conditions of saturating oxygen tension. As turnover is increased all three centres becomes progressively reduced. Analysis of the steady states indicated that all three centres remained in apparent equilibrium with cytochrome c throughout the titration. The calculated redox potentials of CuA (+224 mV) and haem a (+267 mV) were consistent with previous equilibrium data. The 655 nm band was also found to be oxygen and flux sensitive. It may be a useful additional in vivo detectable chromophore. However, it titrated with an apparent redox potential of +230 mV, far from its equilibrium value (+400 mV). The implications of these results for the interpretation of non invasive measurements of mitochondrial function are discussed.},

@article{Ruitenberg:2000p10226,
	Abstract = {The reductive part of the catalytic cycle of cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans was examined by using time-resolved potential measurements on black lipid membranes. Proteoliposomes were adsorbed to the black lipid membranes and Ru(II)(2, 2'-bipyridyl)(3)(2+) was used as photoreductant to measure flash-induced membrane potential generation. Single-electron reduction of the oxidized wild-type cytochrome c oxidase reveals two phases of membrane potential generation (tau(1) approximately 20 micros and tau(2) approximately 175 micros) at pH 7.4. The fast phase is not sensitive to cyanide and is assigned to electron transfer from Cu(A) to heme a. The slower phase is inhibited completely by cyanide and shows a kinetic deuterium isotope effect by a factor of 2-3. Although two enzyme variants mutated in the so-called D pathway of proton transfer (D124N and E278Q) show the same time constants and relative amplitudes as the wild-type enzyme, in the K pathway variant K354M, tau(2) is increased to 900 micros. This result suggests uptake of a proton through the K pathway during the transition from the oxidized to the one-electron reduced state. After the second laser flash under anaerobic conditions, a third electrogenic phase with a time constant of approximately 1 ms appears. The amplitude of this phase grows with increasing flash number. We explain this growth by injection of a second electron into the single-electron reduced enzyme. On multiple flashes, both D pathway mutants behave differently compared with the wild type and two additional slow phases of tau(3) approximately 2 ms and tau(4) approximately 15 ms are observed. These results suggest that the D pathway is involved in proton transfer coupled to the uptake of the second electron.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), found in the inner mitochondrial membranes or in many bacteria, catalyzes the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Four protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane through CcO. In this study, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations are used to probe the spectroscopic characteristics of the ferryl intermediates in the aa(3) CcO/O(2) reaction. These highly elaborate calculations, supported by several calculations on smaller model systems, demonstrate the sensitivity of vibrational frequencies on the Coulombic field of heme a(3) and their dependence on the distance of the adjacent Cu(B) to the heme a(3)-Fe atom. This distance seems to be associated with the protonation state of the heme a(3) propionate A, and we propose that it plays a crucial role on the mechanism of action of CcO. In detail, we link proton pumping activity in CcO enzyme (a) to a multiple (1:1:2) resonance among the frequencies of Fe(IV)=O bond stretching, the breathing mode of Histidine 411, and a bending mode of the His411-Fe(IV)=O species (aa(3) from Paracoccus denitrificans numbering) and (b) to Cu(B) displacement by electrostatic interactions toward the heme a(3) iron. We find that the vibrations of the His411-Fe(IV)=O unit become highly coupled depending on the protonation state of the heme a(3) ring A propionate/Asp399 pair, and we propose a mechanism for the resonance Raman enhancement of the bending mode delta(His411-Fe(IV)=O). Calculations on model systems demonstrate that the position of Cu(B) in relation to heme a(3) iron-oxo plays a crucial role in regulating that resonance. We also discuss the origin of the coupling between bending, delta(His411-Fe(IV)=O) and nu(Fe=O) stretching modes, and the role played by such vibrational coupling interactions or Cu(B) position in controlling functional properties of the enzyme, including electron/proton coupling as well as experimental spectra.},

@article{Robinson:1993p7444,
	Abstract = {Bovine cytochrome c oxidase usually contains 3-4 mol of tightly bound cardiolipin per cytochrome aa3 complex. At least two of these cardiolipins are required for full electron transport activity. Without the tightly bound cardiolipin, cytochrome c oxidase has only 40-50% of its original activity when assayed in detergents that support activity, e.g., dodecyl maltoside. By measuring the restoration of electron transport activity, functional binding constants for cardiolipin and a number of cardiolipin analogues have been evaluated (Kd,app = 1 microM for cardiolipin). These binding constants agree reasonably well with direct measurement of the binding using [14C]-acetyl-cardiolipin (Kd < 0.1 microM) when the enzyme is solubilized with Triton X-100. These data are discussed in relationship to the wealth of data that is known about the association of cardiolipin with cytochrome c oxidase and the other mitochondrial electron transport complexes and transporters.},

@article{Michel:1999p5651,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water, a process in which four electrons, four protons, and one molecule of oxygen are consumed. The reaction is coupled to the pumping of four additional protons across the membrane. According to the currently accepted concept, the pumping of all four protons occurs after the binding of oxygen to the reduced enzyme and is exclusively coupled to the last two electron transfer steps. A careful analysis of the existing data shows that there is no experimental evidence for this paradigm. It is more likely that only three protons are pumped during the second half of the catalytic cycle of cytochrome c oxidase after the reaction with oxygen. In this article a variant of a recent mechanistic model of proton pumping by electrostatic repulsion is discussed. It is based on the electroneutrality principle in a way that in the catalytic cycle each electron transfer to the membrane-embedded electron acceptors is charge-compensated by uptake of one proton. The mechanism takes into account the findings with mutant cytochrome c oxidases and explains the results of many recent experiments, including the effects of hydrogen peroxide.},

	Abstract = {Well ordered reproducible crystals of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides yield a previously unreported structure at 2.0 A resolution that contains the two catalytic subunits and a number of alkyl chains of lipids and detergents. Comparison with crystal structures of other bacterial and mammalian CcOs reveals that the positions occupied by native membrane lipids and detergent substitutes are highly conserved, along with amino acid residues in their vicinity, suggesting a more prevalent and specific role of lipid in membrane protein structure than often envisioned. Well defined detergent head groups (maltose) are found associated with aromatic residues in a manner similar to phospholipid head groups, likely contributing to the success of alkyl glycoside detergents in supporting membrane protein activity and crystallizability. Other significant features of this structure include the following: finding of a previously unreported crystal contact mediated by cadmium and an engineered histidine tag; documentation of the unique His-Tyr covalent linkage close to the active site; remarkable conservation of a chain of waters in one proton pathway (D-path); and discovery of an inhibitory cadmium-binding site at the entrance to another proton path (K-path). These observations provide important insight into CcO structure and mechanism, as well as the significance of bound lipid in membrane proteins.},

M. haemolytica is the causative agent in the economically important and fatal disease of cattle termed shipping fever. The periplasmic iron-binding protein of this gram-negative bacterium, which has homologous counterparts in many other pathogenic species, performs a key role in iron acquisition from mammalian host serum iron transport proteins and is essential for the survival of the pathogen within the host. The ferric (Fe(3+)) ion in the closed structure is bound by a novel asymmetric constellation of four ligands, including a synergistic carbonate anion. The open structure is ligated by three tyrosyl residues and a dynamically disordered solvent-exposed anion. Our results clearly implicate the synergistic anion as the primary mediator of global protein conformation and provide detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms of iron binding and release in the periplasm.},

@article{Sharpe:2009p9845,
	Abstract = {We examined the anion binding behavior of the Mg(Mn) site in cytochrome c oxidase to test a possible role of this center in proton pumping. Rhodobacter sphaeroides grown in a Mn(II)-rich medium replaces the intrinsic Mg(II) ion with an EPR-detectable Mn(II) ion without change in activity. Due to its close proximity and a shared ligand, oxidized Cu(A) is spin-coupled to the Mn(II) ion, affecting the EPR spectrum. An examination of both bovine and R.s. oxidase crystal structures reveals a hydrogen-bonding pattern in the vicinity of the Mg(II) site that is consistent with three water ligands of the Mg(Mn) center when Cu(A) is oxidized. In the reduced structure, one water molecule in the vicinity of the Cu(A) ligand, E198, moves closer, appearing to be converted into an ionically bonded hydronium ion, while a second water molecule bonded to Mg(Mn) shows evidence of conversion to a hydroxide. The implied proton movement is proposed to be part of a redox-linked export of a pumped proton from the binuclear center into the exit pathway. To test the model, cyanide and azide were added to the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme, and Mn(II) CW-EPR and ESEEM spectra were recorded. Addition of azide broadened the CW-EPR spectra for both oxidized and reduced enzyme. Cyanide addition affected the Mn(II) CW-EPR spectrum of reduced cytochrome c oxidase by increasing Mn(II) zero field splitting and broadening the spectral line shapes but had no effect on oxidized enzyme. ESEEM measurements support a differential ability of Mn(II) to bind cyanide in the reduced state of cytochrome c oxidase. This new observation of anion binding at the Mg/Mn site is of interest in terms of accessibility of the buried site and its potential role in redox-dependent proton pumping.},

	Abstract = {The uptake of the element iron is vital for the survival of most organisms. Numerous pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria utilize a periplasm-to-cytosol ATP-binding cassette transport pathway to transport this essential atom in to the cell. In this study, we investigated the Yersinia enterocolitica (YfuA) and Serratia marcescens (SfuA) iron-binding periplasmic proteins. We have determined the 1.8-angstroms structures of iron-loaded (YfuA) and iron-free (SfuA) forms of this class of proteins. Although the sequence of these proteins varies considerably from the other members of the transferrin structural superfamily, they adopt the same three-dimensional fold. The iron-loaded YfuA structure illustrates the unique nature of this new class of proteins in that they are able to octahedrally coordinate the ferric ion in the absence of a bound anion. The iron-free SfuA structure contains a bound citrate anion in the iron-binding cleft that tethers the N- and C-terminal domains of the apo protein and stabilizes the partially open structure.},

	Abstract = {By using the non-redox-active Mg2+/Mn2+ site of cytochrome c oxidase as a probe, water access from the outside of the enzyme and water escape from the buried active site were studied. Water movement was time-resolved by monitoring the magnetic interaction of the oxygen isotope 17O with the Mn2+ by using a rapid freeze-quench-electron spin echo envelope modulation technique. Rapid (msec) access of water from the bulk phase to the Mn2+ was demonstrated by mixing cytochrome c oxidase with H217O. To determine whether a channel involving the Mn2+ was used for water exit from the active site, samples incubated in 17O2 were allowed to turn over approximately five times before freezing. The 17O, now in the form of H217O, was detected at the Mn2+. The significant broadening of the Mn2+ signal after the limited number of turnovers strongly suggests that the water exits the protein by means of one discrete pathway, not by random diffusion.},

	Abstract = {The Density functional theory (B3LYP) has been used to study the mechanisms of O--O bond cleavage and proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase. To understand how the energy from the exergonic reduction of molecular oxygen is used to pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane, the energetics of all steps in the catalytic cycle have to be evaluated. For this purpose, models have to be designed that can accurately reproduce relative redox potentials and pKa values within the active site. The present study shows that it is possible to construct such models and to calculate energy profiles which, to a large extent, agree with experimental information. However, the energy profiles point out a problem with an unbalanced partitioning of the energy between the reductive and oxidative half cycles, which is in disagreement with the experimental observation that the proton pumping is evenly distributed between the two half cycles. A conclusion from the present study is, therefore, that something is probably still missing in the modeling of the active site.},

	Abstract = {We address the molecular mechanism by which the haem-copper oxidases translocate protons. Reduction of O2 to water takes place at a haem iron-copper (CuB) centre, and protons enter from one side of the membrane through a 'channel' structure in the enzyme. Statistical-mechanical calculations predict bound water molecules within this channel, and mutagenesis experiments show that breaking this water structure impedes proton translocation. Hydrogen-bonded water molecules connect the channel further via a conserved glutamic acid residue to a histidine ligand of CuB. The glutamic acid side chain may have to move during proton transfer because proton translocation is abolished if it is forced to interact with a nearby lysine or arginine. Perturbing the CuB ligand structure shifts an infrared mode that may be ascribed to the O-H stretch of bound water. This is sensitive to mutations of the glutamic acid, supporting its connectivity to the histidine. These results suggest key roles of bound water, the glutamic acid and the histidine copper ligand in the mechanism of proton translocation.},

	Abstract = {Using a combination of stopped-flow spectrophotometric proton pumping measurements and time-resolved potential measurements on black lipid membranes, we have investigated the effect of Zn(2+) ions on the proton transfer properties of Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase. When zinc was enclosed in the interior of cytochrome c oxidase containing liposomes, the H/e stoichiometry was found to gradually decrease with increasing Zn(2+) concentration. Half-inhibition of proton pumping was observed at [Zn(2+)](i)=75 microM corresponding to about 5-6 Zn(2+) ions per oxidase molecule. In addition, there was a significant increase in the respiratory control ratio of the proteoliposomes upon incorporation of Zn(2+). Time-resolved potential measurements on a black lipid membrane showed that the electrogenic phases slowed down in the presence of Zn(2+) correspond to phases that have been attributed to proton uptake from the cytoplasmic side and to proton pumping. We conclude that Zn(2+) ions bind close to or within the two proton transfer pathways of the bacterial cytochrome c oxidase.},

	Abstract = {Using a combination of electronic spectroscopies and DFT calculations, the effect of pH perturbation on the geometric and electronic structure of the CuA site has been defined. Descriptions are developed for high pH (pH = 7) and low pH (pH = 4) forms of CuA azurin and its H120A mutant which address the discrepancies concerning the extent of delocalization indicated by multifrequency EPR and ENDOR data (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 7274; Biophys. J. 2002, 82, 2758). Our resonance Raman and MCD spectra demonstrate that the low pH and H120A mutant forms are essentially identical and are the perturbed forms of the completely delocalized high pH CuA site. However, in going from high pH to low pH, a seven-line hyperfine coupling pattern associated with complete delocalization of the electron (S = 1/2) over two Cu coppers (I(Cu) = 3/2) changes into a four-line pattern reflecting apparent localization. DFT calculations show that the unpaired electron is delocalized in the low pH form and reveal that its four-line hyperfine pattern results from the large EPR spectral effects of approximately 1% 4s orbital contribution of one Cu to the ground-state spin wave function upon protonative loss of its His ligand. The contribution of the Cu-Cu interaction to electron delocalization in this low symmetry protein site is evaluated, and the possible functional significance of the pH-dependent transition in regulating proton-coupled electron transfer in cytochrome c oxidase is discussed.},

@article{Brzezinski:2003p9848,
	Abstract = {One of the key problems of molecular bioenergetics is the understanding of the function of redox-driven proton pumps on a molecular level. One such class of proton pumps are the heme-copper oxidases. These enzymes are integral membrane proteins in which proton translocation across the membrane is driven by electron transfer from a low-potential donor, such as, e.g. cytochrome c, to a high-potential acceptor, O(2). Proton pumping is associated with distinct exergonic reaction steps that involve gradual reduction of oxygen to water. During the process of O(2) reduction, unprotonated high pK(a) proton acceptors are created at the catalytic site. Initially, these proton acceptors become protonated as a result of intramolecular proton transfer from a residue(s) located in the membrane-spanning part of the enzyme, but removed from the catalytic site. This residue is then reprotonated from the bulk solution. In cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the proton is initially transferred from a glutamate, E(I-286), which has an apparent pK(a) of 9.4. According to a recently published structure of the enzyme, the deprotonation of E(I-286) is likely to result in minor structural changes that propagate to protonatable groups on the proton output (positive) side of the protein. We propose that in this way, the free energy available from the O(2) reduction is conserved during the proton transfer. On the basis of the observation of these structural changes, a possible proton-pumping model is presented in this paper. Initially, the structural changes associated with deprotonation of E(I-286) result in the transfer of a proton to an acceptor for pumped protons from the input (negative) side of the membrane. After reprotonation of E(I-286) this acceptor releases a proton to the output side of the membrane.},

	Abstract = {Aluminium and zinc phosphides are highly effective insecticides and rodenticides and are used widely to protect grain in stores and during its transportation. Acute poisoning with these compounds may be direct due to ingestion of the salts or indirect from accidental inhalation of phosphine generated during their approved use. MECHANISMS OF TOXICITY: Both forms of poisoning are mediated by phosphine which has been thought to be toxic because it inhibits cytochrome c oxidase. While phosphine does inhibit cytochrome C oxidase in vitro, the inhibition is much less in vivo. It has been shown recently in nematodes that phosphine rapidly perturbs mitochondrial morphology, inhibits oxidative respiration by 70%, and causes a severe drop in mitochondrial membrane potential. This failure of cellular respiration is likely to be due to a mechanism other than inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase. In addition, phosphine and hydrogen peroxide can interact to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical and phosphine also inhibits catalase and peroxidase; both mechanisms result in hydroxyl radical associated damage such as lipid peroxidation. The major lethal consequence of phosphide ingestion, profound circulatory collapse, is secondary to factors including direct effects on cardiac myocytes, fluid loss, and adrenal gland damage. In addition, phosphine and phosphides have corrosive actions.},

@article{Durr:2008p6162,
	Abstract = {Asparagine 131, located near the cytoplasmic entrance of the D-pathway in subunit I of the Paracoccus denitrificans aa(3) cytochrome c oxidase, is a residue crucial for proton pumping. When replaced by an aspartate, the mutant enzyme is completely decoupled: while retaining full cytochrome c oxidation activity, it does not pump protons. The same phenotype is observed for two other substitutions at this position (N131E and N131C), whereas a conservative replacement by glutamine affects both activities of the enzyme. The N131D variant oxidase was crystallized and its structure was solved to 2.32-A resolution, revealing no significant overall change in the protein structure when compared with the wild type (WT), except for an alternative orientation of the E278 side chain in addition to its WT conformation. Moreover, remarkable differences in the crystallographically resolved chain of water molecules in the D-pathway are found for the variant: four water molecules that are observed in the water chain between N131 and E278 in the WT structure are not visible in the variant, indicating a higher mobility of these water molecules. Electrochemically induced Fourier transform infrared difference spectra of decoupled mutants confirm that the protonation state of E278 is unaltered by these mutations but indicate a distinct perturbation in the hydrogen-bonding environment of this residue. Furthermore, they suggest that the carboxylate side chain of the N131D mutant is deprotonated. These findings are discussed in terms of their mechanistic implications for proton routing through the D-pathway of cytochrome c oxidase.},

@article{Branden:2002p9871,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-driven proton pump. The enzyme has two proton input pathways, leading from the solution on the N-side to the binuclear center. One of these pathways, the K-pathway, is used for proton uptake upon reduction of the binuclear center. It is also important for local charge compensation during reaction of the fully reduced enzyme with O2. Two different locations have been proposed to constitute the entry point of the K-pathway: near S(I-299) or near E(II-101), respectively, in the Rhodobacter sphaeroides enzyme. The experiments discussed in this study are aimed at identifying the location of the entry point. The kinetics and extent of flash-induced proton release coupled to oxidation of heme a3 (tau congruent with 2 ms at pH 8.8 in the wild-type enzyme) in the absence of O2 were investigated in the ED(II-101), SD(I-299), and KM(I-362) mutant enzymes, i.e., at the two proposed entry points and in the middle of the pathway, respectively. This reaction was completely blocked in KM(I-362), while it was slowed by factors of 25 and 40 in the ED(II-101) and SD(I-299) mutant enzymes, respectively. During reaction of the fully reduced enzyme with O2, electron transfer from heme a to the catalytic site (during P(R)-formation) was blocked in the KM(I-362) and SD(I-299)/SG(I-299) but not in the ED(II-101)/ EA(II-101) mutant enzymes. The results are interpreted as follows: Residue K(I-362) is involved in both proton transfer and charge compensation (in different reaction steps). The impaired proton release in the S(I-299) mutant enzymes is an indirect effect due to an altered environment of K(I-362). E(II-101), on the other hand, is likely to be part of the K-pathway since mutation of this residue results in impaired proton release but does not affect the P(R) formation kinetics; i.e., the properties of K(I-362) are not altered. Consequently, we conclude that the entry point of the K-pathway is located near E(II-101).},

	Abstract = {Gaining detailed understanding of the energetics of the proton-pumping process in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is one of the challenges of modern biophysics. Despite promising mechanistic proposals, most works have not related the activation barriers of the different assumed steps to the protein structure, and there has not been a physically consistent model that reproduced the barriers needed to create a working pump. This work reevaluates the activation barriers for the primary proton transfer (PT) steps by calculations that reflect all relevant free energy contributions, including the electrostatic energies of the generated charges, the energies of water insertion, and large structural rearrangements of the donor and acceptor. The calculations have reproduced barriers that account for the directionality and sequence of events in the primary PT in CcO. It has also been found that the PT from Glu-286 (E) to the propionate of heme a(3) (Prd) provides a gate for an initial back leakage from the high pH side of the membrane. Interestingly, the rotation of E that brings it closer to Prd appears to provide a way for blocking competing pathways in the primary PT. Our study elucidates and quantifies the nature of the control of the directionality in the primary PT in CcO and provides instructive insight into the role of the water molecules in biological PT, showing that "bridges" of several water molecules in hydrophobic regions present a problem (rather than a solution) that is minimized in the primary PT.},

	Abstract = {Aerobically grown Rhodobacter sphaeroides synthesizes a respiratory chain similar to that of eukaryotes. We describe the purification of the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase of Rb. sphaeroides as a highly active (Vmax > or = 1800 s-1), three-subunit enzyme from isolated, washed cytoplasmic membranes by hydroxylapatite chromatography and anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. The purified oxidase exhibits biphasic kinetics of oxidation of mammalian cytochrome c, similar to mitochondrial oxidases, and pumps protons efficiently (H+/e- = 0.7) following reconstitution into phospholipid vesicles. A membrane-bound cytochrome c is associated with the aa3-type oxidase in situ, but is removed during purification. The EPR spectra of the Rb. sphaeroides enzyme suggest the presence of a strong hydrogen bond to one or both of the histidine ligands of heme a. In other respects, optical, EPR, and resonance Raman analyses of the metal centers and their protein environments demonstrate a close correspondence between the bacterial enzyme and the structurally more complex bovine cytochrome c oxidase. The results establish this bacterial oxidase as an excellent model system for the mammalian enzyme and provide the basis for site-directed mutational analysis of its energy transducing function.},

Data on the membrane sidedness of Bohr protons linked to anaerobic oxido-reduction of the individual metal centers in the liposome reconstituted oxidase are analysed. Redox Bohr protons coupled to anaerobic oxido-reduction of heme a (and Cu(A)) and Cu(B) exhibit membrane vectoriality, i.e. protons are taken up from the inner space upon reduction of these centers and released in the outer space upon their oxidation. Redox Bohr protons coupled to anaerobic oxido-reduction of heme a(3) do not, on the contrary, exhibit vectorial nature: protons are exchanged only with the outer space. A model of the proton pump of the oxidase, in which redox Bohr protons linked to the low-spin heme a play a central role, is described.

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of cellular respiration in mitochondria and many bacteria, reduces O(2) to water. This four-electron reduction process is coupled to translocation (pumping) of four protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane; however, proton pumping is poorly understood. Proton pumping was thought to be linked exclusively to the oxidative phase, that is, to the transfer of the third and fourth electron. Upon re-evaluation of these data, however, this proposal has been questioned, and a transport mechanism including proton pumping in the reductive phase--that is, during the transfer of the first two electrons--was suggested. Subsequently, additional studies reported that proton pumping during the reductive phase can occur, but only when it is immediately preceded by an oxidative phase. To help clarify the issue we have measured the generation of the electric potential across the membrane, starting from a defined one-electron reduced state. Here we show that a second electron transfer into the enzyme leads to charge translocation corresponding to pumping of one proton without necessity for a preceding turnover.},

	Abstract = {A mechanism for proton pumping is described that is based on chemiosmotic principles and the detailed molecular structures now available for cytochrome oxidases. The importance of conserved water positions and a step-wise gated process of proton translocation is emphasized, where discrete electron transfer events are coupled to proton uptake and expulsion. The trajectory of each pumped proton is the same for all four substrate electrons. An essential role for the His-Tyr cross-linked species is discussed, in gating of the D- and K-channels and as an acceptor/donor of electrons and protons at the binuclear center.},

@article{Lee:2009p8180,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase utilizes the energy from electron transfer and reduction of oxygen to water and pumps protons across the membrane, generating a proton motive force. A large body of biochemical work has shown that all the pumped protons enter the enzyme through the D-channel, which is apparent in X-ray structures as a chain of water molecules connecting D132 at the cytoplasmic surface of the enzyme to E286, near the enzyme active site. The exit pathway utilized by pumped protons beyond this point and leading to the bacterial periplasm is not known. Also not known is the proton loading site (or sites) which undergoes changes in pKa in response to the chemistry at the enzyme active site and drives the proton pump mechanism. In this paper, we examine the role of R481, a highly conserved arginine that forms an ion pair with the D-propionate of heme a3. The R481H, R481N, R481Q, and R481L mutants were examined. The R481H mutant oxidase is approximately 18% active and pumps protons with approximately 40% of the stoichiometry of the wild type. The R481N, R481Q, and R481L mutants each retain only approximately 5% of the steady-state activity, and this is shown to be due to inhibition of steps in the reaction of O(2) with the reduced enzyme. Neither the R481N mutant nor the R481Q mutant oxidases pump protons, but remarkably, the R481L mutant does pump protons with the same efficiency as the R481H mutant. Since the proton pump is clearly operating in the R481L mutant, these results rule out an essential role in the proton pump mechanism for R481 or its hydrogen bond partner, the D-propionate of heme a3.},

@article{Brzezinski:1998p5542,
	Abstract = {During the last few years our knowledge of the structure and function of heme copper oxidases has greatly profited from the use of site-directed mutagenesis in combination with biophysical techniques. This, together with the recently-determined crystal structures of cytochrome c oxidase, has now made it possible to design experiments aimed at targeting specific pump mechanisms. Here, we summarize results from our recent kinetic studies of electron and proton-transfer reactions in wild-type and mutant forms of cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These studies have made it possible to identify amino acid residues involved in proton transfer during specific reaction steps and provide a basis for discussion of mechanisms of electron and proton transfer in terminal oxidases. The results indicate that the pathway through K(I-362)/T(I-359), but not through D(I-132)/E(I-286), is used for proton transfer to a protonatable group interacting electrostatically with heme a3, i.e., upon reduction of the binuclear center. The pathway through D(I-132)/E(I-286) is used for uptake of pumped and substrate protons during the pumping steps during O2 reduction.},

@article{Bu:2005p7741,
	Abstract = {The structural, energetic, and electronic and IR spectroscopic properties for a model of the cross-linked histidine-tyrosine (His-Tyr) residues as found in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) are investigated by ab initio methods. The formation of a His-Tyr radical is studied by two paths: proton release followed by electron release and vice versa. The energetics for the proton/electron releases of the Tyr depend modestly on the cross-linked His substituent and, more sensitively, on the charge of the cation attached to the imino N site of the His residue. Protonation of the imino N site significantly increases the electron ionization potential and decreases the proton dissociation energy, making them competitive processes. A positive charge placed at the imino N site, whose value is scanned from zero to one, shows a continuous increase in ionization potential and a decrease in proton dissociation energy, with the +1 limit agreeing well with the protonated imino N site result, indicating a dominant electrostatic effect. The charge populations and the spin density distributions of the His-Tyr model, the radical cation formed by electron ionization, the anion formed by proton dissociation, and the final His-Tyr radical depend sensitively on the substituents, implying a modulation role on the charge transfer between the phenol and imidazole rings, especially for the charged species. His-Tyr and protonated His-Tyr exhibit differences among their respective structural isomers with consequences on their IR absorptions. Small barriers between their pseudo-cis and pseudo-trans rotamers demonstrate the relative flexibility between the two rings, and these may facilitate proton release and charge transfer. The cation effect demonstrates that the cationized cross-linked His-Tyr should be the best candidate to mimic the covalently ring-linked histidine-tyrosine structure in CcO.},

@article{Chakrabarty:2011p9605,
	Abstract = {Gaining detailed understanding of the energetics of the proton-pumping process in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a problem of great current interest. Despite promising mechanistic proposals, so far, a physically consistent model that would reproduce all the relevant barriers needed to create a working pump has not been presented. In addition, there are major problems in elucidating the origin of key mutational effects and in understanding the nature of the apparent pK(a) values associated with the pH dependencies of specific proton transfer (PT) reactions in CcO. This work takes a key step in resolving the above problems, by considering mutations, such as the Asn139Asp replacement, that blocks proton pumping without affecting PT to the catalytic site. We first introduce a formulation that makes it possible to relate the apparent pK(a) of Glu286 to different conformational states of this residue. We then use the new formulation along with the calculated pK(a) values of Glu286 at these different conformations to reproduce the experimentally observed apparent pK(a) of the residue. Next, we take the X-ray structures of the native and Asn139Asp mutant of the Paracoccus denitrificans CcO (N131D in this system) and reproduce for the first time the change in the primary PT pathways (and other key features) based on simulations that start with the observed structural changes. We also consider the competition between proton transport to the catalytic site and the pump site, as a function of the bulk pH, as well as the H/D isotope effect, and use this information to explore the relative height of the two barriers. The paper emphasizes the crucial role of energy-based considerations that include the PT process, and the delicate control of PT in CcO.},

@article{Kaila:2009p6199,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal enzyme of aerobic respiration. The energy released from the reduction of molecular oxygen to water is used to pump protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane. The pump function introduces a mechanistic requirement of a valve that prevents protons from flowing backwards during the process. It was recently found that Glu-242, a key amino acid in transferring protons to be pumped across the membrane and to the site of oxygen reduction, fulfils the function of such a valve by preventing simultaneous contact to the pump site and to the proton-conducting D-channel (Kaila V.R.I. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 2008). Here we have incorporated the valve model into the framework of the reaction mechanism. The function of the Glu valve is studied by exploring how the redox state of the surrounding metal centers, dielectric effects, and membrane potential, affects the energetics and leaks of this valve. Parallels are drawn between the dynamics of Glu-242 and the long-standing obscure difference between the metastable O(H) and stable O states of the binuclear center. Our model provides a suggestion for why reduction of the former state is coupled to proton translocation while reduction of the latter is not.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the effect of Zn ions on proton-transfer reactions in cytochrome c oxidase. In the absence of Zn(2+) the transition from the "peroxy" (P(R)) to the "ferryl" (F) intermediate has a time constant of approximately 100 micros and it is associated with proton transfer from the bulk solution with an intrinsic time constant of <<100 micros, but rate limited by the P(R)-->F transition. While in the presence of 100 microM Zn(2+) the P(R)-->F transition was slowed by a factor of approximately 2, proton uptake from the bulk solution was impaired to a much greater extent. Instead, about two protons (one proton in the absence of Zn(2+)) were taken up during the next reaction step, i.e. the decay of F to the oxidized (O) enzyme with a time constant of approximately 2.5 ms. Thus, the results show that there is one proton available within the enzyme that can be used for oxygen reduction and confirm our previous observation that F can be formed without proton uptake from the bulk solution. No effect of Zn(2+) was observed with a mutant enzyme in which Asp(I-132), at the entry point of the D-pathway, was replaced by its non-protonatable analogue Asn. In addition, no effect of Zn(2+) was observed on the F-->O transition rate when measured in D(2)O, because in D(2)O, the transition is internally slowed to approximately 10 ms, which is already slower than with bound Zn(2+). Together with earlier results showing that both the P(R)-->F and F-->O transitions are associated with proton uptake through the D-pathway, the results from this study indicate that Zn(2+) binds to and blocks the entrance of the D-pathway.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Extensive preclinical and clinical evidence suggests mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Studies of brain energy metabolism in bipolar disorder suggest an impairment of energy generation by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Lithium is an effective drug widely used in treating bipolar disorder, but its mechanism of action has remained uncertain. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of lithium on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. METHODS: We spectrophotometrically determined the activities of the respiratory chain complexes I + III [antimycin A-sensitive nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cytochrome c oxidorductase], complexes II + III (succinate cytochrome c oxidoreductase), succinate dehydrogenase, and complex IV [cytochrome c oxidase (COX)], and of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme citrate synthase in postmortem human brain cortex homogenates following exposure to lithium (up to 10 mM). RESULTS: Activities of complexes I + III and of complexes II + III were dose-dependently increased by lithium with maximum values at 1 mM (165%, p = 0.03, and 146%, p = 0.00002, of controls). Activity of succinate dehydrogenase remained unchanged up to 2 mM, but was raised at higher drug concentrations (maximum 220%, p = 0.01, of controls). In contrast, activity of COX was not significantly affected by the drug (decrease of 12% at 1 mM, p = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that lithium stimulates mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities at clinically relevant concentrations. Lithium's effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain presents further evidence of the pathophysiological significance of mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder. The effect may be relevant to the therapeutic efficacy of the drug by potentially reversing a disease-related alteration.},

	Abstract = {The high resolution three-dimensional x-ray structure of the metal sites of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase is reported. Cytochrome c oxidase is the largest membrane protein yet crystallized and analyzed at atomic resolution. Electron density distribution of the oxidized bovine cytochrome c oxidase at 2.8 A resolution indicates a dinuclear copper center with an unexpected structure similar to a [2Fe-2S]-type iron-sulfur center. Previously predicted zinc and magnesium sites have been located, the former bound by a nuclear encoded subunit on the matrix side of the membrane, and the latter situated between heme a3 and CuA, at the interface of subunits I and II. The O2 binding site contains heme a3 iron and copper atoms (CuB) with an interatomic distance of 4.5 A; there is no detectable bridging ligand between iron and copper atoms in spite of a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between them. A hydrogen bond is present between a hydroxyl group of the hydroxyfarnesylethyl side chain of heme a3 and an OH of a tyrosine. The tyrosine phenol plane is immediately adjacent and perpendicular to an imidazole group bonded to CuB, suggesting a possible role in intramolecular electron transfer or conformational control, the latter of which could induce the redox-coupled proton pumping. A phenyl group located halfway between a pyrrole plane of the heme a3 and an imidazole plane liganded to the other heme (heme a) could also influence electron transfer or conformational control.},

@article{Henry:2011p10221,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, utilizes the reduction of dioxygen into water to pump protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The principal pathway of proton uptake into the enzyme, the D channel, is a 2.5 nm long channel-like cavity named after a conserved, negatively charged aspartic acid (D) residue thought to help recruiting protons to its entrance (D132 in the first subunit of the S. sphaeroides enzyme). The single-point mutation of D132 to asparagine (N), a neutral residue, abolishes enzyme activity. Conversely, replacing conserved N139, one-third into the D channel, by D, induces a decoupled phenotype, whereby oxygen reduction proceeds but not proton pumping. Intriguingly, the double mutant D132N/N139D, which conserves the charge of the D channel, restores the wild-type phenotype. We use molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic calculations to examine the structural and physical basis for the coupling of proton pumping and oxygen chemistry in single and double N139D mutants. The potential of mean force for the conformational isomerization of N139 and N139D side chains reveals the presence of three rotamers, one of which faces the channel entrance. This out-facing conformer is metastable in the wild-type and in the N139D single mutant, but predominant in the double mutant thanks to the loss of electrostatic repulsion with the carboxylate group of D132. The effects of mutations and conformational isomerization on the pKa of E286, an essential proton-shuttling residue located at the top of the D channel, are shown to be consistent with the electrostatic control of proton pumping proposed recently (Fadda et al 2008 Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1777 277-84). Taken together, these results suggest that preserving the spatial distribution of charges at the entrance of the D channel is necessary to guarantee both the uptake and the relay of protons to the active site of the enzyme. These findings highlight the interplay of long-range electrostatic forces and local structural fluctuations in the control of proton movement and provide a physical explanation for the restoration of proton pumping activity in the double mutant.},

@article{Henry:2009p4543,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase couples the reduction of dioxygen to proton pumping against an electrochemical gradient. The D-channel, a 25-A-long cavity, provides the principal pathway for the uptake of chemical and pumped protons. A water chain is thought to mediate the relay of protons via a Grotthuss mechanism through the D-channel, but it is interrupted at N139 in all available crystallographic structures. We use free-energy simulations to examine the proton uptake pathway in the wild type and in single-point mutants N139V and N139A, in which redox and pumping activities are compromised. We present a general approach for the calculation of water occupancy in protein cavities and demonstrate that combining efficient sampling algorithms with long simulation times (hundreds of nanoseconds) is required to achieve statistical convergence of equilibrium properties in the protein interior. The relative population of different conformational and hydration states of the D-channel is characterized. Results shed light on the role of N139 in the mechanism of proton uptake and clarify the physical basis for inactive phenotypes. The conformational isomerization of the N139 side chain is shown to act as a gate controlling the formation of a functional water chain or "proton wire." In the closed state of N139, the spatial distribution of water in the D-channel is consistent with available crystallographic models. However, a metastable state of N139 opens up a narrow bottleneck in which 50% occupancy by a water molecule establishes a proton pathway throughout the D-channel. Results for N139V suggest that blockage of proton uptake resulting from persistent interruption of the water pathway is the cause of this mutant's marginal oxidase activity. In contrast, results for N139A indicate that the D-channel is a continuously hydrated cavity, implying that the decoupling of oxidase activity from proton pumping measured in this mutant is not due to interruption of the proton relay chain.},

	Abstract = {In the respiratory chain free energy is conserved by linking the chemical reduction of dioxygen to the electrogenic translocation of protons across a membrane. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is one of the sites where this linkage occurs. Although intensively studied, the molecular mechanism of proton pumping by this enzyme remains unknown. Here, we present data from an investigation of a mutant CcO from Rhodobacter sphaeroides [Asn-139 --> Asp, ND(I-139)] in which proton pumping is completely uncoupled from the catalytic turnover (i.e., reduction of O2). However, in this mutant CcO, the rate by which O2 is reduced to H2O is even slightly higher than that of the wild-type CcO. The data indicate that the disabling of the proton pump is a result of a perturbation of E(I-286), which is located 20 A from N(I-139) and is an internal proton donor to the catalytic site, located in the membrane-spanning part of CcO. The mutation results in raising the effective pKa of E(I-286) by 1.6 pH units. An explanation of how the mutation uncouples catalytic turnover from proton pumping is offered, which suggests a mechanism by which CcO pumps protons.},

@article{Liu:2011p9691,
	Abstract = {Crystal structures in both oxidized and reduced forms are reported for two bacterial cytochrome c oxidase mutants that define the D and K proton paths, showing conformational change in response to reduction and the loss of strategic waters that can account for inhibition of proton transfer. In the oxidized state both mutants of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides enzyme, D132A and K362M, show overall structures similar to wild type, indicating no long-range effects of mutation. In the reduced state, the mutants show an altered conformation similar to that seen in reduced wild type, confirming this reproducible, reversible response to reduction. In the strongly inhibited D132A mutant, positions of residues and waters in the D pathway are unaffected except in the entry region close to the mutation, where a chloride ion replaces the missing carboxyl and a 2-{\AA} shift in N207 results in loss of its associated water. In K362M, the methionine occupies the same position as the original lysine, but K362- and T359-associated waters in the wild-type structure are missing, likely accounting for the severe inhibition. Spectra of oxidized frozen crystals taken during X-ray radiation show metal center reduction, but indicate development of a strained configuration that only relaxes to a native form upon annealing. Resistance of the frozen crystal to structural change clarifies why the oxidized conformation is observable and supports the conclusion that the reduced conformation has functional significance. A mechanism is described that explains the conformational change and the incomplete response of the D-path mutant.},

@article{Fetter:1995p6852,
	Abstract = {As the final electron acceptor in the respiratory chain of eukaryotic and many prokaryotic organisms, cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water and generates a proton gradient. To test for proton pathways through the oxidase, site-directed mutagenesis was applied to subunit I of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides enzyme. Mutants were characterized in three highly conserved regions of the peptide, comprising possible proton loading, unloading, and transfer sites: an interior loop between helices II and III (Asp132Asn/Ala), an exterior loop between helices IX and X (His411Ala, Asp412Asn, Thr413Asn, Tyr414Phe), and the predicted transmembrane helix VIII (Thr352Ala, Pro358Ala, Thr359Ala, Lys362Met). Most of the mutants had lower activity than wild type, but only mutants at residue 132 lost proton pumping while retaining electron transfer activity. Although electron transfer was substantially inhibited, no major structural alteration appears to have occurred in D132 mutants, since resonance Raman and visible absorbance spectra were normal. However, lower CO binding (70-85% of wild type) suggests some minor change to the binuclear center. In addition, the activity of the reconstituted Asp132 mutants was inhibited rather than stimulated by ionophores or uncoupler. The inhibition was not observed with the purified enzyme and a direct pH effect was ruled out, suggesting an altered response to the electrical or pH gradient. The results support an important role for the conserved II-III loop in the proton pumping process and are consistent with the possibility of involvement of residues in helix VIII and the IX-X loop.},

@article{Marantz:1998p9862,
	Abstract = {The experiments presented in this study address the problem of how the cytoplasmic surface (proton-input side) of cytochrome c oxidase interacts with protons in the bulk. For this purpose, the cytoplasmic surface of the enzyme was labeled with a fluorescein (Flu) molecule covalently bound to Cys223 of subunit III. Using the Flu as a proton-sensitive marker on the surface and phiOH as a soluble excited-state proton emitter, the dynamics of the acid-base equilibration between the surface and the bulk was measured in the time-resolved domain. The results were analyzed by using a rigorous kinetic analysis that is based on numeric integration of coupled nonliner differential rate equations in which the rate constants are used as adjustable parameters. The analysis of 11 independent measurements, carried out under various initial conditions, indicated that the protonation of the Flu proceeds through multiple pathways involving diffusion-controlled reactions and proton exchange among surface groups. The surface of the protein carries an efficient system made of carboxylate and histidine moieties that are sufficiently close to each other as to form a proton-collecting antenna. It is the passage of protons among these sites that endows cytochrome c oxidase with the capacity to pick up protons from the buffered cytoplasmic matrix within a time frame compatible with the physiological turnover of the enzyme.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the electron-proton coupling during the peroxy (P(R)) to oxo-ferryl (F) and F to oxidised (O) transitions in cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The kinetics of these reactions were investigated in two different mutant enzymes: (1) ED(I-286), in which one of the key residues in the D-pathway, E(I-286), was replaced by an aspartate which has a shorter side chain than that of the glutamate and, (2) ML(II-263), in which the redox potential of Cu(A) is increased by approximately 100 mV, which slows electron transfer to the binuclear centre during the F-->O transition by a factor of approximately 200. In ED(I-286) proton uptake during P(R)-->F was slowed by a factor of approximately 5, which indicates that E(I-286) is the proton donor to P(R). In addition, in the mutant enzyme the F-->O transition rate displayed a deuterium isotope effect of approximately 2.5 as compared with approximately 7 in the wild-type enzyme. Since the entire deuterium isotope effect was shown to be associated with a single proton-transfer reaction in which the proton donor and acceptor must approach each other (M. Karpefors, P. Adelroth, P. Brzezinski, Biochemistry 39 (2000) 6850), the smaller deuterium isotope effect in ED(I-286) indicates that proton transfer from E(I-286) determines the rate also of the F-->O transition. In ML(II-263) the electron-transfer to the binuclear centre is slower than the intrinsic proton-transfer rate through the D-pathway. Nevertheless, both electron and proton transfer to the binuclear centre displayed a deuterium isotope effect of approximately 8, i.e., about the same as in the wild-type enzyme, which shows that these reactions are intimately coupled.},

	Abstract = {Zinc ions are shown to be an efficient inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, both in the solubilized and the liposome-reconstituted enzyme. The effect of zinc is biphasic. First there occurs rapid interaction of zinc with the enzyme at a site exposed to the aqueous phase corresponding to the mitochondrial matrix. This interaction is fully reversed by EDTA and results in a partial inhibition of the enzyme activity (50-90%, depending on preparation) with an effective K(i) of approximately 10 microM. The rapid effect of zinc is observed with the solubilized enzyme, it vanishes upon incorporation of cytochrome oxidase in liposomes, and it re-appears when proteoliposomes are supplied with alamethicin that makes the membrane permeable to low molecular weight substances. Zinc presumably blocks the entrance of the D-protonic channel opening into the inner aqueous phase. Second, zinc interacts slowly (tens of minutes, hours) with a site of cytochrome oxidase accessible from the outer aqueous phase bringing about complete inhibition of the enzymatic activity. The slow phase is characterized by high affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme: full inhibition can be achieved upon incubation of the solubilized oxidase for 24 h with zinc concentration as low as 2 microM. The rate of zinc inhibitory action in the slow phase is proportional to Zn(2+) concentration. The slow interaction of zinc with the outer surface of liposome-reconstituted cytochrome oxidase is observed only with the enzyme turning over or in the presence of weak reductants, whereas incubation of zinc with the fully oxidized proteoliposomes does not induce the inhibition. It is shown that zinc ions added to cytochrome oxidase proteoliposomes from the outside inhibit specifically the slow electrogenic phase of proton transfer, coupled to a transition of cytochrome oxidase from the oxo-ferryl to the oxidized state (the F --> O step corresponding to transfer of the 4th electron in the catalytic cycle).},

@article{Branden:2005p7717,
	Abstract = {In cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), exergonic electron transfer reactions from cytochrome c to oxygen drive proton pumping across the membrane. Elucidation of the proton pumping mechanism requires identification of the molecular components involved in the proton transfer reactions and investigation of the coupling between internal electron and proton transfer reactions in CcO. While the proton-input trajectory in CcO is relatively well characterized, the components of the output pathway have not been identified in detail. In this study, we have investigated the pH dependence of electron transfer reactions that are linked to proton translocation in a structural variant of CcO in which Arg481, which interacts with the heme D-ring propionates in a proposed proton output pathway, was replaced with Lys (RK481 CcO). The results show that in RK481 CcO the midpoint potentials of hemes a and a(3) were lowered by approximately 40 and approximately 15 mV, respectively, which stabilizes the reduced state of Cu(A) during reaction of the reduced CcO with O(2). In addition, while the pH dependence of the F --> O rate in wild-type CcO is determined by the protonation state of two protonatable groups with pK(a) values of 6.3 and 9.4, only the high-pK(a) group influences this rate in RK481 CcO. The results indicate that the protonation state of the Arg481 heme a(3) D-ring propionate cluster having a pK(a) of approximately 6.3 modulates the rate of internal electron transfer and may act as an acceptor of pumped protons.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) converts the energy from redox and oxygen chemistry to support proton translocation and create a transmembrane DeltamuH(+) used for ATP production. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to probe for the formation water chains capable of participating in proton translocation. Attention was focused on the region between and above the a and a(3) hemes where well-defined water chains have not been identified in crystallographic studies. An arginine (R481) (Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering), positioned between the D-propionates of the hemes, had been mutated in vivo to lysine and showed to have altered activity consistent with an altered proton conductance [Qian, J., Mills, D. A., Geren, L., Wang, K. F., Hoganson, C. W., Schmidt, B., Hiser, C., Babcock, G. T., Durham, B., Millett, F., and Ferguson-Miller, S. (2004) Role of the conserved arginine pair in proton and electron transfer in cytochrome c oxidase, Biochemistry 43, 5748-5756; also see the accompanying paper by Mills et al.]. This mutant was created in silico, and the MD results for the mutant and wild type were compared to explore the effects on the formation of hydrogen-bonded water chains by this mutation. The simulations reveal the presence of hydrogen-bonded water chains that lead from E286 through the region above the hemes to the Mg(2+), and from E286 to the heme a(3) D-propionate and the binuclear center. The R481K mutant does not form as many, or as extensive, water chains as wild-type CcO, due to a new conformation of residues in a large loop between helices III and IV in subunit I, indicating a reduction in the level of water chain formation in the mutant. This loop appears to play a role in controlling the formation of hydrogen-bonded water chains above the hemes. The results suggest a possible gating mechanism for proton movement that includes key residues W172 and Y175 on the loop and F282 on helix VI.},

	Abstract = {Free energy calculations are fundamental to obtaining accurate theoretical estimates of many important biological phenomena including hydration energies, protein-ligand binding affinities and energetics of conformational changes. Unlike traditional free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods, lambda-dynamics treats the conventional "lambda" as a dynamic variable in free energy simulations and simultaneously evaluates thermodynamic properties for multiple states in a single simulation. In the present article, we provide an overview of the theory of lambda-dynamics, including the use of biasing and restraining potentials to facilitate conformational sampling. We review how lambda-dynamics has been used to rapidly and reliably compute relative hydration free energies and binding affinities for series of ligands, to accurately identify crystallographically observed binding modes starting from incorrect orientations, and to model the effects of mutations upon protein stability. Finally, we suggest how lambda-dynamics may be extended to facilitate modeling efforts in structure-based drug design.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-driven proton pump, which couples the reduction of oxygen to water to the translocation of protons across the membrane. The recently solved x-ray structures of cytochrome c oxidase permit molecular dynamics simulations of the underlying transport processes. To eventually establish the proton pump mechanism, we investigate the transport of the substrates, oxygen and protons, through the enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations of oxygen diffusion through the protein reveal a well-defined pathway to the oxygen-binding site starting at a hydrophobic cavity near the membrane-exposed surface of subunit I, close to the interface to subunit III. A large number of water sites are predicted within the protein, which could play an essential role for the transfer of protons in cytochrome c oxidase. The water molecules form two channels along which protons can enter from the cytoplasmic (matrix) side of the protein and reach the binuclear center. A possible pumping mechanism is proposed that involves a shuttling motion of a glutamic acid side chain, which could then transfer a proton to a propionate group of heme alpha 3.},

@article{Lange:2002p7473,
	Abstract = {Small diffusible redox proteins facilitate electron transfer in respiration and photosynthesis by alternately binding to integral membrane proteins. Specific and transient complexes need to be formed between the redox partners to ensure fast turnover. In respiration, the mobile electron carrier cytochrome c shuttles electrons from the cytochrome bc1 complex to cytochrome c oxidase. Despite extensive studies of this fundamental step of energy metabolism, the structures of the respective electron transfer complexes were not known. Here we present the crystal structure of the complex between cytochrome c and the cytochrome bc1 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The complex was crystallized with the help of an antibody fragment, and its structure was determined at 2.97-A resolution. Cytochrome c is bound to subunit cytochrome c1 of the enzyme. The tight and specific interactions critical for electron transfer are mediated mainly by nonpolar forces. The close spatial arrangement of the c-type hemes unexpectedly suggests a direct and rapid heme-to-heme electron transfer at a calculated rate of up to 8.3 x 10(6) s(-1). Remarkably, cytochrome c binds to only one recognition site of the homodimeric multisubunit complex. Interestingly, the occupancy of quinone in the Qi site is higher in the monomer with bound cytochrome c, suggesting a coordinated binding and reduction of both electron-accepting substrates. Obviously, cytochrome c reduction by the cytochrome bc1 complex can be regulated in response to respiratory conditions.},

Here, we present a systematic procedure for point charge derivation, based on quantum mechanical methodology suited for the systems at hand. A notable difference to previous procedures is to include an outer region around the actual system of interest. At the cost of increasing the system sizes, here up to 265 atoms, including the surroundings achieves near-neutrality for the systems as well as structural stability, important factors for reliable charge distributions. In addition, the common problem of converting between C--H bonds and C--C bonds at the border vanishes. We apply the procedure to the four redox-active metal centers of cytochrome c oxidase: Cu(A), haem a, haem a(3), and Cu(B). Several relevant charge and ligand states are considered. Charges for two different force fields, CHARMM and AMBER, are presented.},

	Abstract = {Accurate force fields are essential for describing biological systems in a molecular dynamics simulation. To analyze the docking of the small redox protein cytochrome c (cyt c) requires simulation parameters for the heme in both the reduced and oxidized states. This work presents parameters for the partial charges and geometries for the heme in both redox states with ligands appropriate to cyt c. The parameters are based on both protein X-ray structures and ab initio density functional theory (DFT) geometry optimizations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The simulations with the new parameter set reproduce the geometries of the X-ray structures and the interaction energies between water and heme prosthetic group obtained from B3LYP/6-31G* calculations. The parameter set developed here will provide new insights into docking processes of heme containing redox proteins.},

	Abstract = {In this study we examined the properties of supported planar bilayers (SPBs) formed from phospholipid components that comprise the mitochondrial inner membrane. We used 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and cardiolipin (CL). Liposomes of binary POPE:POPC (1:1, mol:mol) and ternary (POPE:POPC:CL (0.5:0.3:0.2, mol:mol:mol) composition were used in the formation of SPBs on mica. The characterization of the SPBs was carried out below (4 degrees C) and above (24 and 37 degrees C) the phase transition temperature (Tm) of the mixtures in solution. We observed: (i) that the thickness of the bilayers, calculated from a cross-sectional analysis, decreased as the visualization temperature increased; (ii) the existence of laterally segregated domains that respond to temperature in SPBs of POPE:POPC:CL; (iii) a decrease in height and an increase in roughness (Ra) of SPBs after cytochrome c (cyt c) injection at room temperature. To obtain further insight into the nature of the interaction between cyt c and the bilayers, the competition between 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and the protein for the same binding sites in liposomes was monitored by fluorescence. The results confirm the existence of preferential interaction of cyt c with CL containing liposomes. Taking these results and those of previous papers published by the group, we discuss the preferential adsorption of cyt c in CL domains. This provides support for the relevance of these phospholipids as a proton trap in the oxidative phosphorylation process that occurs in the energy transducing membranes.},

@article{Mills:2008p7675,
	Abstract = {Eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and homologous prokaryotic forms of Rhodobacter and Paraccocus differ in the EPR spectrum of heme a. It was noted that a histidine ligand of heme a (H102) is hydrogen bonded to serine in Rhodobacter (S44) and Paraccocus CcOs, in contrast to glycine in the bovine enzyme. Mutation of S44 to glycine shifts the heme a EPR signal from g(z) = 2.82 to 2.86, closer to bovine heme a at 3.03, without modifying other properties. Mutation to aspartate, however, results in an oppositely shifted and split heme a EPR signal of g(z) = 2.72/2.78, accompanied by lower activity and drastically inhibited intrinsic electron transfer from CuA to heme a. This intrinsic rate is biphasic; the proportion that is slow is pH dependent, as is the relative intensity of the two EPR signal components. At pH 8, the heme a EPR signal at 2.72 is most intense, and the electron transfer rate (CuA to heme a) is 10-130 s(-1), compared to wild-type at 90,000 s(-1). At pH 5.5, the signal at 2.78 is intensified, and a biphasic rate is observed, 50% fast (approximately wild type) and 50% slow (90 s(-1)). The data support the prediction that the hydrogen-bonding partner of the histidine ligand of heme a is one determinant of the EPR spectral difference between bovine and bacterial CcO. We further demonstrate that the heme a redox potential can be dramatically altered by a nearby carboxyl, whose protonation leads to a proton-coupled electron transfer process.},

@article{Muramoto:2007p8383,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase transfers electrons and protons for dioxygen reduction coupled with proton pumping. These electron and proton transfers are tightly coupled with each other for the effective energy transduction by various unknown mechanisms. Here, we report a coupling mechanism by a histidine (His-503) at the entrance of a proton transfer pathway to the dioxygen reduction site (D-pathway) of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase. In the reduced state, a water molecule is fixed by hydrogen bonds between His-503 and Asp-91 of the D-pathway and is linked via two water arrays extending to the molecular surface. The microenvironment of Asp-91 appears in the x-ray structure to have a proton affinity as high as that of His-503. Thus, Asp-91 and His-503 cooperatively trap, on the fixed water molecule, the proton that is transferred through the water arrays from the molecular surface. On oxidation, the His-503 imidazole plane rotates by 180 degrees to break the hydrogen bond to the protonated water and releases the proton to Asp-91. On reduction, Asp-91 donates the proton to the dioxygen reduction site through the D-pathway. The proton collection controlled by His-503 was confirmed by partial electron transfer inhibition by binding of Zn2+ and Cd2+ to His-503 in the x-ray structures. The estimated Kd for Zn2+ binding to His-503 in the x-ray structure is consistent with the reported Kd for complete proton-pumping inhibition by Zn2+ [Kannt A, Ostermann T, Muller H, Ruitenberg M (2001) FEBS Lett 503:142-146]. These results suggest that His-503 couples the proton transfer for dioxygen reduction with the proton pumping.},

	Abstract = {Thirty years after Peter Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize for the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which links the mitochondrial membrane potential generated by the proton pumps of the electron transport chain to ATP production by ATP synthase, the molecular players involved once again attract attention. This is so because medical research increasingly recognizes mitochondrial dysfunction as a major factor in the pathology of numerous human diseases, including diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and ischemia reperfusion injury. We propose a model linking mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to human disease, through a lack of energy, excessive free radical production, or a combination of both. We discuss the regulation of OxPhos by cell signaling pathways as a main regulatory mechanism in higher organisms, which in turn determines the magnitude of the mitochondrial membrane potential: if too low, ATP production cannot meet demand, and if too high, free radicals are produced. This model is presented in light of the recently emerging understanding of mechanisms that regulate mammalian cytochrome c oxidase and its substrate cytochrome c as representative enzymes for the entire OxPhos system.},

	Abstract = {The membrane-bound enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal member in the respiratory chain, converts oxygen into water and generates an electrochemical gradient by coupling the electron transfer to proton pumping across the membrane. Here we have investigated the dynamics of an excess proton and the surrounding protein environment near the active sites. The multi-state empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the explicit dynamics of proton transfer through the critically important hydrophobic channel between Glu242 (bovine notation) and the D-propionate of heme a3 (PRDa3) for the first time. The results from these molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the PRDa3 can indeed re-orientate and dissociate from Arg438, despite the high stability of such an ion pair, and has the ability to accept protons via bound water molecules. Any large conformational change of the adjacent heme a D-propionate group is, however, sterically blocked directly by the protein. Free energy calculations of the PRDa3 side chain isomerization and the proton translocation between Glu242 and the PRDa3 site have also been performed. The results exhibit a redox state-dependent dynamical behavior and indicate that reduction of the low-spin heme a may initiate internal transfer of the pumped proton from Glu242 to the PRDa3 site.},

	Abstract = {We present a molecular dynamics study of cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans in the fully oxidized state, embedded in a fully hydrated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer membrane. Parallel simulations with different levels of protein hydration, 1.125 ns each in length, were carried out under conditions of constant temperature and pressure using three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions and full electrostatics to investigate the distribution and dynamics of water molecules and their corresponding hydrogen-bonded networks inside cytochrome c oxidase. The majority of the water molecules had residence times shorter than 100 ps, but a few water molecules are fixed inside the protein for up to 1.125 ns. The hydrogen-bonded network in cytochrome c oxidase is not uniformly distributed, and the degree of water arrangement is variable. The average number of solvent sites in the proton-conducting K- and D-pathways was determined. In contrast to single water files in narrow geometries we observe significant diffusion of individual water molecules along these pathways. The highly fluctuating hydrogen-bonded networks, combined with the significant diffusion of individual water molecules, provide a basis for the transfer of protons in cytochrome c oxidase, therefore leading to a better understanding of the mechanism of proton pumping.},

	Abstract = {The phospholipid composition of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cells resuspended in various hypertonic solutions has been examined by thin-layer chromatography and ESI mass spectrometry. R. sphaeroides responds to hyperosmotic stress by increasing the amount of cardiolipin in the membranes; this phenomenon occurs in spheroplasts also. Cardiolipin increases quickly and continuously during the time when the cells are resuspended in hypertonic medium. The optimum of stimulation of the neosynthesis of cardiolipin during osmotic stress was found to be at external 1 osm. ESI-MS analyses allowed the identification of two different cardiolipins in R. sphaeroides: the tetravaccenylcardiolipin ([M - H](-), m/z 1456.9) and the trivaccenylmonopalmitoylcardiolipin ([M - H](-), m/z 1430.0).},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-driven proton pump that creates a membrane proton gradient responsible for driving ATP synthesis in aerobic cells. The crystal structure of the enzyme has been recently solved; however, the details of the mechanism of its proton pumping remain unknown. The enzyme internal water molecules play a key role in proton translocation through the enzyme. Here, we examine the thermodynamic properties of internal water in a hydrophobic cavity around the catalytic center of the enzyme. The crystal structure does not show any water molecules in this region; it is believed, however, that, since protons are delivered to the catalytic center, where the reduction of molecular oxygen occurs, at least some water molecules must be present there. The goal of the present study was to examine how many water molecules are present in the catalytic center cavity and why these water molecules are not observed in the crystal structure of the enzyme. The behavior of water molecules is discussed in the context of redox-coupled proton translocation in the enzyme.},

@article{Deng:2008p6854,
	Abstract = {The binding of a ligand to a receptor is often associated with the displacement of a number of bound water molecules. When the binding site is exposed to the bulk region, this process may be sampled adequately by standard unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories. However, when the binding site is deeply buried and the exchange of water molecules with the bulk region may be difficult to sample, the convergence and accuracy in free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations can be severely compromised. These problems are further compounded when a reduced system including only the region surrounding the binding site is simulated. To address these issues, we couple molecular dynamics (MD) with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to allow the number of water to fluctuate during an alchemical FEP calculation. The atoms in a spherical inner region around the binding pocket are treated explicitly while the influence of the outer region is approximated using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP). At each step during thermodynamic integration, the number of water in the inner region is equilibrated with GCMC and energy data generated with MD is collected. Free energy calculations on camphor binding to a deeply buried pocket in cytochrome P450cam, which causes about seven water molecules to be expelled, are used to test the method. It concluded that solvation free energy calculations with the GCMC/MD method can greatly improve the accuracy of the computed binding free energy compared to simulations with fixed number of water.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase moves both electrons and protons in its dual role as a terminal electron acceptor and a contributor to the proton motive force which drives the formation of ATP. Although the sequence of electron transfer events is well-defined, the correlated mechanism and routes by which protons are translocated across the membrane are not. A recent model [Michel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998) 12819] offers a detailed molecular description of when and how protons are translocated through the protein to the outside, which contrasts with previous models in several respects. This article reviews the behavior of site-directed mutants of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase in the context of these different models. Studies of the internally located lysine 362 on the K channel and aspartate 132 on the D channel, indicate that D132, but not K362, is connected to the exterior region. Analysis of the externally located arginine pair, 481 and 482, and the Mg/Mn ligands, histidine 411 and aspartate 412, which are part of the hydrogen-bonded network that includes the heme propionates, indicates that alterations in this region do not strongly compromise proton pumping, but do influence the pH dependence of overall activity and the control of activity by the pH gradient. The results are suggestive of a region of 'sequestered' protons: beyond a major energetic gate, but selectively responsive to the external environment.},

	Abstract = {Aerobic life is based on a molecular machinery that utilizes oxygen as a terminal electron sink. The membrane-bound cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water in mitochondria and many bacteria. The energy released in this reaction is conserved by pumping protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane, creating an electrochemical proton gradient that drives production of ATP. A crucial question is how the protons pumped by CcO are prevented from flowing backwards during the process. Here, we show by molecular dynamics simulations that the conserved glutamic acid 242 near the active site of CcO undergoes a protonation state-dependent conformational change, which provides a valve in the pumping mechanism. The valve ensures that at any point in time, the proton pathway across the membrane is effectively discontinuous, thereby preventing thermodynamically favorable proton back-leakage while maintaining an overall high efficiency of proton translocation. Suppression of proton leakage is particularly important in mitochondria under physiological conditions, where production of ATP takes place in the presence of a high electrochemical proton gradient.},

@article{Deng:2009p6597,
	Abstract = {An increasing number of studies have reported computations of the standard (absolute) binding free energy of small ligands to proteins using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and explicit solvent molecules that are in good agreement with experiments. This encouraging progress suggests that physics-based approaches hold the promise of making important contributions to the process of drug discovery and optimization in the near future. Two types of approaches are principally used to compute binding free energies with MD simulations. The most widely known is the alchemical double decoupling method, in which the interaction of the ligand with its surroundings are progressively switched off. It is also possible to use a potential of mean force (PMF) method, in which the ligand is physically separated from the protein receptor. For both of these computational approaches, restraining potentials may be activated and released during the simulation for sampling efficiently the changes in translational, rotational, and conformational freedom of the ligand and protein upon binding. Because such restraining potentials add bias to the simulations, it is important that their effects be rigorously removed to yield a binding free energy that is properly unbiased with respect to the standard state. A review of recent results is presented, and differences in computational methods are discussed. Examples of computations with T4-lysozyme mutants, FKBP12, SH2 domain, and cytochrome P450 are discussed and compared. Remaining difficulties and challenges are highlighted.},

@article{Scott:2010p8553,
	Abstract = {Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) fly at up to 9000 m elevation during their migration over the Himalayas, sustaining high metabolic rates in the severe hypoxia at these altitudes. We investigated the evolution of cardiac energy metabolism and O(2) transport in this species to better understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation. Compared to low-altitude geese (pink-footed geese and barnacle geese), bar-headed geese had larger lungs and higher capillary densities in the left ventricle of the heart, both of which should improve O(2) diffusion during hypoxia. While myoglobin abundance and the activities of many metabolic enzymes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase, citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase) showed only minor variation between species, bar-headed geese had a striking alteration in the kinetics of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the heteromeric enzyme that catalyzes O(2) reduction in oxidative phosphorylation. This was reflected by a lower maximum catalytic activity and a higher affinity for reduced cytochrome c. There were small differences between species in mRNA and protein expression of COX subunits 3 and 4, but these were inconsistent with the divergence in enzyme kinetics. However, the COX3 gene of bar-headed geese contained a non-synonymous substitution at a site that is otherwise conserved across vertebrates and resulted in a major functional change of amino acid class (Trp-116-->Arg). This mutation was predicted by structural modelling to alter the interaction between COX3 and COX1. Adaptations in mitochondrial enzyme kinetics and O(2) transport capacity may therefore contribute to the exceptional ability of bar-headed geese to fly high.},

@article{ShinzawaItoh:2007p5268,
	Abstract = {All 13 lipids, including two cardiolipins, one phosphatidylcholine, three phosphatidylethanolamines, four phosphatidylglycerols and three triglycerides, were identified in a crystalline bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) preparation. The chain lengths and unsaturated bond positions of the fatty acid moieties determined by mass spectrometry suggest that each lipid head group identifies its specific binding site within CcOs. The X-ray structure demonstrates that the flexibility of the fatty acid tails facilitates their effective space-filling functions and that the four phospholipids stabilize the CcO dimer. Binding of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to the O(2) transfer pathway of CcO causes two palmitate tails of phosphatidylglycerols to block the pathway, suggesting that the palmitates control the O(2) transfer process.The phosphatidylglycerol with vaccenate (cis-Delta(11)-octadecenoate) was found in CcOs of bovine and Paracoccus denitrificans, the ancestor of mitochondrion, indicating that the vaccenate is conserved in bovine CcO in spite of the abundance of oleate (cis-Delta(9)-octadecenoate). The X-ray structure indicates that the protein moiety selects cis-vaccenate near the O(2) transfer pathway against trans-vaccenate. These results suggest that vaccenate plays a critical role in the O(2) transfer mechanism.},

	Abstract = {The molecular mechanism for proton conduction in the D-pathway of Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO) is investigated through the free energy profile, i.e., potential of mean force (PMF) calculations of both the native enzyme and the N98D mutant. The multistate empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) model was applied to simulate the interaction of an excess proton with the channel environment. In the study of the wild type enzyme, the PMF reveals the previously proposed proton trap inside the channel; it also shows a high free energy barrier against the passage of proton at the entry of the channel, where two conserved asparagines (ASN80/98) may be essential for the gating of proton uptake. We also present data from an investigation of the N98D mutant, which has been previously shown to completely eliminate proton pumping but significantly enhance the oxidase activity in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These results suggest that mutating Asn98 to negatively charged aspartate will create an unfavorable energy barrier sufficiently high to prevent the overall proton uptake through the D-pathway, whereas with a protonated aspartic acid the proton conduction was found to be accelerated. Plausible explanations for the origin of the uncoupling of proton pumping from the oxidase activity will be discussed.},

	Abstract = {The CuB metal center is at the core of the active site of the heme-copper oxidases, comprising a copper atom ligating three histidine residues one of which is covalently bonded to a tyrosine residue. Using quantum chemical methodology, we have studied the CuB site in several redox and ligand states proposed to be intermediates of the catalytic cycle. The importance of the His-Tyr crosslink was investigated by comparing energetics, charge, and spin distributions between systems with and without the crosslink. The His-Tyr bond was shown to decrease the proton affinity and increase the electron affinity of both Tyr-244 and the copper. A previously unnoticed internal electronic equilibrium between the copper atom and the tyrosine was observed, which seems to be coupled to the unique structure of the system. In certain states the copper and Tyr-244 compete for the unpaired electron, the localization of which is determined by the oxygenous ligand of the copper. This electronic equilibrium was found to be sensitive to the presence of a positive charge 10 A away from the center, simulating the effect of Lys-319 in the K-pathway of proton transfer. The combined results provide an explanation for why the heme-copper oxidases need two pathways of proton uptake, and why the K-pathway is active only in the second half of the reaction cycle.},

These gradients are maintained by membrane-bound proton transporters that employ free energy provided by, for example, electron transfer or light. In recent years, the structures of several membrane proteins involved in proton translocation have been determined, and indicate that both protein-bound water molecules and protonatable amino acid residues play central roles in transmembrane proton conduction. From these structures, in combination with functional studies, have emerged general principles of proton transfer across membranes and control mechanisms for such reactions, in particular with regard to the electron-transfer-driven proton pump cytochrome c oxidase.},

	Abstract = {The integral mitochondrial membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase (ferrocytochrome-c:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.9.3.1) was crystallized from solutions of the protein from bovine heart isolated as described earlier [Yoshikawa, S. {\&} Caughey, W. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 412-420]. Crystallinity was demonstrated by x-ray diffraction. Microcrystals (tetragonal prisms, 0.02 mm in the largest dimension) were obtained in high yield with retention of activity and contained Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mg in approximate atom ratios of 1.0:1.25:0.5:0.5, respectively. Analysis of the amino acid residues and the tightly bound detergent support an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kDa, of which 150 kDa is protein (1316 +/- 66 amino acids) and 50 kDa is detergent (Brij 35). Seven major polypeptides are evident by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Adjustments in buffer concentration and other conditions have yielded much larger green crystals, hexagonal bipyramids; a crystal 0.3 X 0.5 X 0.7 mm gave x-ray diffractions as high as 8-A resolution and a space group of P6(2) or P6(4), and cell dimensions of a = b = 174.5 A, c = 282.2 A, alpha = beta = 90 degrees, and gamma = 120 degrees were obtained. A reasonable value of 3.1 A3/Da for Vm, the average space per dalton of protein in the crystal, was obtained for the asymmetric unit, which contains four irons and is a dimer of two minimal catalytic units. Cylindrical dimers (80 X 100 A) estimated from two-dimensional electron diffraction studies [Fuller, S. D., Capaldi, R. A. {\&} Henderson, R. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 134, 305-327] pack well in the crystal lattice with the symmetry of the space group of the crystal. The crystallization procedure developed is useful in purification of the enzyme and shows promise for the production of crystals of sufficiently high order to gain improved structural information from x-ray diffraction.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome ba(3) from Thermus thermophilus is a member of the family of B-type heme-copper oxidases, which have a low degree of sequence homology to the well-studied mitochondrial-like A-type enzymes. Recently, it was suggested that the ba(3) oxidase has only one pathway for the delivery of protons to the active site and that this pathway is spatially analogous to the K-pathway in the A-type oxidases [Chang, H.-Y., et al. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 16169-16173]. This suggested pathway includes two threonines at positions 312 and 315. In this study, we investigated the time-resolved reaction between fully reduced cytochrome ba(3) and O(2) in variants where Thr-312 and Thr-315 were modified. While in the A-type oxidases this reaction is essentially unchanged in variants with the K-pathway modified, in the Thr-312 --> Ser variant in the ba(3) oxidase both reactions associated with proton uptake from solution, the P(R) --> F and F --> O transitions, were slowed compared to those of wild-type ba(3). The observed time constants were slowed approximately 3-fold (for P(R) --> F, from 60 to approximately 170 mus in the wild type) and approximately 30-fold (for F --> O, from 1.1 to approximately 40 ms). In the Thr-315 --> Val variant, the F --> O transition was approximately 5-fold slower (5 ms) than for the wild-type oxidase, whereas the P(R) --> F transition displayed an essentially unchanged time constant. However, the uptake of protons from solution was a factor of 2 slower and decoupled from the optical P(R) --> F transition. Our results thus show that proton uptake is significantly and specifically inhibited in the two variants, strongly supporting the suggested involvement of T312 and T315 in the transfer of protons to the active site during O(2) reduction in the ba(3) oxidase.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiencies are one of the most common defects of the respiratory chain found in mitochondrial diseases. COX is a multimeric inner mitochondrial membrane enzyme formed by subunits encoded by both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genome. COX biosynthesis requires numerous assembly factors that do not form part of the final complex but participate in prosthetic group synthesis and metal delivery in addition to membrane insertion and maturation of COX subunits. Human diseases associated with COX deficiency including encephalomyopathies, Leigh syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, and fatal lactic acidosis are caused by mutations in COX subunits or assembly factors. In the last decade, numerous animal models have been created to understand the pathophysiology of COX deficiencies and the function of assembly factors. These animal models, ranging from invertebrates to mammals, in most cases mimic the pathological features of the human diseases.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations accumulate in a number of ageing tissues and are proposed to play a role in the ageing process. We have previously shown that colonic crypt stem cells accumulate somatic mtDNA point mutations during ageing. These mtDNA mutations result in the loss of the activity of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase (COX)) of the respiratory chain in the stem cells and their progeny, producing colonic crypts which are entirely COX deficient. However it is not known whether the other complexes of the respiratory chain are similarly affected during ageing. Here we have used antibodies to individual subunits of complexes I-IV to investigate their expression in the colonic epithelium from human subjects aged 18-84. We show that in approximately 50% of crypts with any form of respiratory chain deficiency, decreased expression of subunits of multiple complexes is observed. Furthermore we have sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome of a number of cells with multiple complex defects and have found a wide variety of point mutations in these cells affecting a number of different protein encoding and RNA encoding genes. Finally we discuss the possible mechanisms by which multiple respiratory chain complex defects may occur in these cells.},

	Abstract = {Sco1 and Cox17 are accessory proteins required for the correct assembly of eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidase. At variance with Sco1, Cox17 orthologs are found only in eukaryotes. We browsed bacterial genomes to search proteins functionally equivalent to Cox17, and we identified a class of proteins of unknown function displaying a conserved gene neighborhood to bacterial Sco1 genes, all sharing a potential metal binding motif H(M)X10MX21HXM. Two members of this group, DR1885 from Deinococcus radiodurans and CC3502 from Caulobacter crescentus, were expressed, and their interaction with copper was investigated. The solution structure and extended x-ray absorption fine structure data on the former protein reveal that the protein binds copper(I) through a histidine and three Mets in a cupredoxin-like fold. The surface location of the copper-binding site as well as the type of coordination are well poised for metal transfer chemistry, suggesting that DR1885 might transfer copper, taking the role of Cox17 in bacteria. On the basis of our results, a possible pathway for copper delivery to the Cu(A) center in bacteria is proposed.},

	Abstract = {In the presence of the uncoupler, external zinc ions inhibit rapidly turnover of cytochrome c oxidase reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles or bound to the membrane of intact mitochondria. The effect is promoted by electron leaks into the oxidase during preincubation with Zn(2+). Inhibition of liposome-bound bovine cytochrome oxidase by external Zn(2+) titrates with a K(i) of 1+/-0.3 microM. Presumably, the Zn(2+)-binding group at the positively charged side is not reactive in the oxidized enzyme, but becomes accessible to the cation in some partially reduced state(s) of the oxidase; reduction of Cu(B) is tentatively proposed to be responsible for the effect.},

@article{Fadda:2008p5482,
	Abstract = {As part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, cytochrome c oxidase utilizes the energy produced by the reduction of O2 to water to fuel vectorial proton transport. The mechanism coupling proton pumping to redox chemistry is unknown. Recent advances have provided evidence that each of the four observable transitions in the complex catalytic cycle consists of a similar sequence of events. However, the physico-chemical basis underlying this recurring sequence has not been identified. We identify this recurring pattern based on a comprehensive model of the catalytic cycle derived from the analysis of oxygen chemistry and available experimental evidence. The catalytic cycle involves the periodic repetition of a sequence of three states differing in the spatial distribution of charge in the active site: [0|1], [1|0], and [1|1], where the total charge of heme a and the binuclear center appears on the left and on the right, respectively. This sequence recurs four times per turnover despite differences in the redox chemistry. This model leads to a simple, robust, and reproducible sequence of electron and proton transfer steps and rationalizes the pumping mechanism in terms of electrostatic coupling of proton translocation to redox chemistry. Continuum electrostatic calculations support the proposed mechanism and suggest an electrostatic origin for the decoupled and inactive phenotypes of ionic mutants in the principal proton-uptake pathway.},

Recently, time-resolved measurements have elucidated the sequence of events in proton translocation, and shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms. One crucial property of the proton pump mechanism has received less attention, viz. how proton leaks are avoided. Here, we will analyse this topic and demonstrate how the key proton-carrying residue Glu-242 (numbering according to the sequence of subunit I of bovine heart CcO) functions as a valve that has the effect of minimising back-leakage of the pumped proton.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations were reported in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. However, very little information is available on the mtDNA mutation pattern in the histologically negative surgical margins and tumors of HNSCC patients who experienced tumor recurrence. The present study aimed at understanding the nature and timing of mtDNA mutation in histologically negative margins, and tumors in HNSCC patients who developed local recurrence during the follow-ups. The entire 16.5-kb mitochondrial genome was sequenced in matched normal lymphocytes, histologically normal margins, and tumors of 50 recurrent HNSCC patients. The mtDNA mutations were then compared with clinical parameters. Forty-eight percent (24 of 50) of patients harbored at least one somatic mtDNA mutation in the tumor, and a total of 37 somatic mtDNA mutations were detected. The mtDNA mutations were mostly heteroplasmic in nature and nucleotide transitions (A<-->G; T<-->C). Forty-six percent of the mutations (17 of 37) were detected in the tumors and were also detectable in the corresponding histologically normal margin of the patients. The mtDNA mutations involved both coding and noncoding regions of the mtDNA. The majority (9 of 17, 53%) of the noncoding mutations involved tRNAs. Seventy-five percent (15 of 20) of the coding mtDNA mutations were nonsynonymous in nature and mainly affected cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), frequently altered in different human mitochondrial diseases including cancer. Analysis of mtDNA mutation could be an invaluable tool for molecular assessment of histologically negative margins and as well for monitoring HNSCC patients with locoregional recurrences.},

	Abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the progression of a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Thus, enhancing mitochondrial function could potentially help ameliorate the impairments of neural plasticity and cellular resilience associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. A series of studies was undertaken to investigate the effects of mood stabilizers on mitochondrial function, and against mitochondrially mediated neurotoxicity. We found that long-term treatment with lithium and valproate (VPA) enhanced cell respiration rate. Furthermore, chronic treatment with lithium or VPA enhanced mitochondrial function as determined by mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial oxidation in SH-SY5Y cells. In-vivo studies showed that long-term treatment with lithium or VPA protected against methamphetamine (Meth)-induced toxicity at the mitochondrial level. Furthermore, these agents prevented the Meth-induced reduction of mitochondrial cytochrome c, the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COX) activity. Oligoarray analysis demonstrated that the gene expression of several proteins related to the apoptotic pathway and mitochondrial functions were altered by Meth, and these changes were attenuated by treatment with lithium or VPA. One of the genes, Bcl-2, is a common target for lithium and VPA. Knock-down of Bcl-2 with specific Bcl-2 siRNA reduced the lithium- and VPA-induced increases in mitochondrial oxidation. These findings illustrate that lithium and VPA enhance mitochondrial function and protect against mitochondrially mediated toxicity. These agents may have potential clinical utility in the treatment of other diseases associated with impaired mitochondrial function, such as neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {Internal electron transfer (ET) to heme a(3) during anaerobic reduction of oxidized bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) was studied under conditions where heme a and Cu(A) were fully reduced by excess hexaamineruthenium. The data show that ET to heme a(3) is controlled by the state of ionization of a single protolytic residue with a pK(a) of 6.5 +/- 0.2. On the basis of the view that ET to the catalytic site is limited by coupled proton transfer, this pK(a) was attributed to Glu60 which is located at the entrance of the proton-conducting K channel on the matrix side of CcO. It is proposed that Glu60 controls proton entry into the channel. However, even with this channel open, there is the second factor that regulates ET, and this is ascribed to the rate of proton diffusion in the channel. In addition, it is concluded that proton transfer in the K channel is reversibly inhibited by the detergent Triton X-100. It is also found that the rate of ET to heme a(3) in the as-isolated resting enzyme and in CcO "activated" by reaction of fully reduced enzyme with O(2) is the same, implying that the catalytic sites of these two forms of oxidized enzyme are essentially identical.},

	Abstract = {An extremely slow pH dependent conformational equilibrium between a valence-delocalized and a valence-trapped species of the dinuclear CuA domain of cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus has been identified and characterized using UV-visible absorption, circular dichroism, time-resolved fluorescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as by stopped-flow kinetic techniques. The results indicated that the nature of this pH dependent conformation change in the CuA domain in the Thermus protein was distinctly different from that observed in the mesophilic analogue from Paracoccus denitrificans and in the engineered CuA domain in azurin. pH jump kinetic studies suggested existence of a fast deprotonation equilibrium followed by slow conformational change in the protein, which is contrary to that observed in the case of the analogous protein from P. denitrificans. Continuous-flow electrospray mass spectral studies on H/D exchange in the TtCuA showed that approximately 75% of the protons are exchanged within the dead-time of the experiment supporting fast proton transfer kinetics in the protein. Analysis of temperature dependence of the kinetics of the conformational transition showed that the rigidity of the protein structure decreases with increase in temperature. The results indicated that though the rate of proton transfer at individual sites in the protein could be very fast, the conformational change that requires simultaneous breaking of several interactions in a segment of the structure might be slow in the thermostable protein.},

	Abstract = {Subunits located near the cardiolipin binding sites of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) were identified by photolabeling with arylazido-cardiolipin analogues and detecting labeled subunits by reversed-phase HPLC and HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Two arylazido-containing cardiolipin analogues were synthesized: (1) 2-SAND-gly-CL with a nitrophenylazido group attached to the polar headgroup of cardiolipin (CL) via a linker containing a cleavable disulfide; (2) 2',2''-bis-(AzC12)-CL with two of the four fatty acid tails of cardiolipin replaced by 12-(N-4-azido-2-nitrophenyl) aminododecanoic acid. Both arylazido-CL derivatives were used to map the cardiolipin binding sites within two types of detergent-solubilized CcO: (1) intact 13-subunit CL-containing CcO (three to four molecules of endogenous CL remain bound per CcO monomer); (2) 11-subunit CL-free CcO (subunits VIa and VIb are missing because they dissociate during CL removal). Upon the basis of these photolabeling studies, we conclude that (1) subunits VIIa, VIIc, and possibly VIII are located near the two high-affinity cardiolipin binding sites, which are present in either form of CcO, and (2) subunit VIa is located adjacent to the lower affinity cardiolipin binding site, which is only present in the 13-subunit form of CcO. These data are consistent with the recent CcO crystal structure in which one cardiolipin is located near subunit VIIa and a second is located near subunit VIa (PDB ID code referenced in Tomitake, T. et al. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 15304-15309). However, we propose that a third cardiolipin is bound between subunits VIIa and VIIc near the entrance to the D-channel. Cardiolipin bound at this location could potentially function as a proton antenna to facilitate proton entry into the D-channel. If true, it would explain the CcO requirement of bound cardiolipin for full electron transport activity.},

	Abstract = {The resonance Raman spectra of the aa3 cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides reveal pH-dependent structural changes in the binuclear site at room temperature. The binuclear site, which is the catalytic center of the enzyme, possesses two conformations at neutral pH, assessed from their distinctly different Fe-CO stretching modes in the resonance Raman spectra of the CO complex of the fully reduced enzyme. The two conformations (alpha and beta) interconvert reversibly in the pH 6-9 range with a pKa of 7.4, consistent with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements done at cryogenic temperatures (D.M. Mitchell, J.P. Sapleigh, A.M.Archer, J.O. Alben, and R.B.Gennis, 1996, Biochemistry 35:9446-9450). It is postulated that the different structures result from a change in the position of the Cu(B) atom with respect to the CO due to the presence of one or more ionizable groups in the vicinity of the binuclear center. The conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-288 in R. sphaeroides, Tyr-244 in the bovine enzyme) that is adjacent to the oxygen-binding pocket or one of the histidines that coordinate Cu(B) are possible candidates. The existence of an equilibrium between the two conformers at physiological pH and room temperature suggests that the conformers may be functionally involved in enzymatic activity.},

	Abstract = {A number of missense mutations in subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase (CytcO) have previously been linked to prostate cancer (Petros et al., 2005). To investigate the effects of these mutations at the molecular level, in the present study we prepared four different structural variants of the bacterial Rhodobacter sphaeroides CytcO (cytochrome aa(3)), each carrying one amino-acid residue replacement corresponding to the following substitutions identified in the above-mentioned study: Asn11Ser, Ala122Thr, Ala341Ser and Val380Ile (residues Asn25, Ser168, Ala384 and Val423 in the R. sphaeroides oxidase). This bacterial CytcO displays essentially the same structural and functional characteristics as those of the mitochondrial counterpart. We investigated the overall activity, proton pumping and internal electron- and proton-transfer reactions in the structural variants. The results show that the turnover activities of the mutant CytcOs were reduced by at most a factor of two. All variants pumped protons, but in Ser168Thr, Ala384Ser and Val423Ile we observed slight internal proton leaks. In all structural variants the internal electron equilibrium was slightly shifted away from the catalytic site at high pH (10), resulting in a slower observed ferryl to oxidized transition. Even though the effects of the mutations were relatively modest, the results suggest that they destabilize the proton-gating machinery. Such effects could be manifested in the presence of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient resulting in less efficient energy conservation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Allosteric cooperativity in respiratory proteins.},

	Abstract = {The powerful technique of energy diagrams has been used to analyze the mechanism for proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase. Energy levels and barriers are derived starting out from recent kinetic experiments for the O to E transition, and are then refined using general criteria and a few additional experimental facts. Both allowed and non-allowed pathways are obtained in this way. A useful requirement is that the forward and backward rate should approach each other for the full membrane gradient. A key finding is that an electron on heme a (or the binuclear center) must have a significant lowering effect on the barrier for proton uptake, in order to prevent backflow from the pump-site to the N-side. While there is no structural gating in the present mechanism, there is thus an electronic gating provided by the electron on heme a. A quantitative analysis of the energy levels in the diagrams, leads to Prop-A of heme a(3) as the most likely position for the pump-site, and the Glu278 region as the place for the transition state for proton uptake. Variations of key redox potentials and pK(a) values during the pumping process are derived for comparison to experiments.},

@article{Varanasi:2011p9635,
	Abstract = {In order to characterize protein structures that control proton uptake, forms of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) containing a carboxyl or a thiol group in line with the initial, internal waters of the D pathway for proton transfer have been assayed in the presence and absence of subunit III. Subunit III provides approximately half of the protein surrounding the entry region of the D pathway. The mutant N139D-D132N contains a carboxyl group 6{\AA} within the D pathway and lacks the normal, surface-exposed proton acceptor, Asp-132. With subunit III, the steady-state activity of this mutant is slow but once subunit III is removed its activity is the same as wild-type CcO lacking subunit III (~1800 H+ s-1). Thus, a carboxyl group ~25% within the pathway enhances proton uptake even though the carboxyl has no direct contact with bulk solvent. Protons from solvent apparently move to internal Asp-139 through a short file of waters, normally blocked by subunit III. Cysteine-139 also supports rapid steady-state proton uptake, demonstrating that an anion other than a carboxyl can attract and transfer protons into the D pathway. When both Asp-132 and Asp/Cys-139 are present, the removal of subunit III increases CcO activity to rates greater than that of normal CcO due to simultaneous proton uptake by two initial acceptors. The results show how the environment of the initial proton acceptor for the D pathway in these CcO forms dictates the pH range of CcO activity, with implications for the function of Asp-132, the normal proton acceptor.},

	Abstract = {The kinetics of electron transfer between cytochrome-c oxidase and ruthenium hexamine has been characterized using the native enzyme or its cyanide complex either solubilized by detergent (soluble cytochrome oxidase) or reconstituted into artificial phospholipid vesicles (cytochrome oxidase-containing vesicles). Ru(NH3)2+6 (Ru(II] reduces oxidized cytochrome a, following (by-and-large) bimolecular kinetics; the second order rate constant using the cyanide complex of the enzyme is 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, for the enzyme in detergent, and slightly higher for COV. In the case of COV the kinetics are not affected by the addition of ionophores. Upon mixing fully reduced cytochrome oxidase with oxygen (in the presence of excess reductants), the oxidation leading to the pulsed enzyme is followed by a steady state phase and (eventually) by complete re-reduction. When the concentrations of dioxygen and oxidase are sufficiently low (micromolar range), the time course of oxidation can be resolved by stopped flow at room temperature, yielding an apparent bimolecular rate constant of 5 x 10(7) M-1 s-1. After exhaustion of oxygen and end of steady state, re-reduction of the pulsed enzyme by the excess Ru(II) is observed; the concentration dependence shows that the rate of re-reduction is limited at 3 s-1 in detergent; this limiting value is assigned to the intramolecular electron transfer process from cytochrome a-Cua to the binuclear center. Using the reconstituted enzyme, the internal electron transfer step is sensitive to ionophores, increasing from 2-3 to 7-8 s-1 upon addition of valinomycin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. This finding indicates for the first time an effect of the electrochemical potential across the membrane on the internal electron transfer rate; the results are compared with expectations based on the hypothesis formulated by Brunori et al. (Brunori, M., Sarti, P., Colosimo, A., Antonini, G., Malatesta, F., Jones, M.G., and Wilson, M.T. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 2365-2368), and their bioenergetic relevance is discussed with reference to the proton pumping activity of the enzyme.},
