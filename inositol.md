Notes on inositol project

# Questions
Could come up with a summary of the mechanism

- Does Abeta cause AD?
- Does inhibition of amyloid formation actually works for curing AD?
- Why is Abeta42 the more toxic species?
- How is Abeta related to toxicity in AD?
- What makes Abeta40 and Abeta42 aggregate differently?

- How are the following related?
	dye binding to fibrils
	ionic conditions and effect on aggregation
	cosolvent effects on aggregation

# Hypotheses of how inositol works with Abeta

- Beta-sheet disruption? (Lemkul) 
- Detergent like? (landel)(what does this even mean ...)

- Why works on Abeta40, but not abeta42?
	- They differ in their activity with respect to 40 and 42 perhaps of their different aggregation properties? (40 and 42 have recently been shown to have different “recycling” properties)
	- Factors not considered in simulation: influence of salt (klement) 
	- Differences in fibril structure.


# Sugar binding to Abeta42
	* Fung and McLaurin et al
		- This is one experimental basis for my paper on inositol versus glucose binding to Abeta
		- What is the story ??? Don't drop this ...
		
- My broad conclusion *now* 
	- inositol is an osmolyte but at given concentration and molar ratio could be enough to bind to a toxic species of Abeta to get rid of it in the body.
	## Inositol molecular mechanism
		- activity at low millimolar concentrations
			- eg:
			- glycerol does something to Abeta at 6 M
			-	inositol can do something at 5 mM
			- perhaps all AD drugs are weak binders
				- but the most effective ones are the ones that can get into the right area of brain at high enough concentrations, does not kill the person, AND have activity towards Abeta
				
				
	## general idea for all binders (some of them summarized from Dobson's talk at Biophysical 2011)
		- There is *no* specific binding site - its a surface that they bind to (idea formed from talking to various people at the biophysical conference)
		- binding is *weak* (This is known for inositol from several sources, including my own data)
		- The trick is to bind to the *correct* species of aggregates, such that toxicity is eliminated
					- Sequestration - toxic *in vivo* effects may be eliminated through sequestering the hydrophobic areas of the monomer; Affibody with nanomolar binding affinity (Dobson)
		
			- or push the equilibrium away from the toxic species towards something that is non-toxic or something that can be cleared from the brain / body.
				- Difficulties:
					- Don't know what is toxic and what is not?
						- fibrils - not toxic?
						- what do all the types of oligomers too like?
							- which one is relevant for toxicity?
				
				- 	Question: structural clues as to what amyloid species is degradable in vivo ?
						(ie. structure - toxcitiy - biodegradable relationship?)
		- For imaging, need higher binding affinities
			- micromolar range or higher
			- because dyes have to be radio active.  Too much radioactive will kill patient.
		
		- "shape" of the drug matters for which aggregate species it binds to
			- Congo red, ThT binds fibrils and not non-beta oligomers
