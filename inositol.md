Notes on inositol project

# Sugar binding to Abeta42
	* Fung and McLaurin et al
		- This is one experimental basis for my paper on inositol versus glucose binding to Abeta
		- What is the story ??? Don't drop this ...
		
- My broad conclusion *now* 
	- inositol is an osmolyte but at given concentration and molar ratio could be enough to bind to a toxic species of Abeta to get rid of it in the body.
	## Inositol molecular mechanism
		- activity at low millimolar concentrations
			- eg:
			- glycerol does something to Abeta at 6 M
			-	inositol can do something at 5 mM
			- perhaps all AD drugs are weak binders
				- but the most effective ones are the ones that can get into the right area of brain at high enough concentrations, does not kill the person, AND have activity towards Abeta
				
	## general idea for all binders
		- There is *no* specific binding site - its a surface that they bind to
		- binding is *weak*
		- The trick is to bind to the *correct* species of aggregates, such that toxicity is eliminated
			- or push the equilibrium away from the toxic species towards something that is non-toxic or something that can be cleared from the brain / body.
				- Difficulties:
					- Don't know what is toxic and what is not?
						- fibrils - not toxic?
						- what do all the types of oligomers too like?
							- which one is relevant for toxicity?
							
		- For imaging, need higher binding affinities
			- micromolar range or higher
			- because dyes have to be radio active.  Too much radioactive will kill patient.
		
		- "shape" of the drug matters for which aggregate species it binds to
			- Congo red, ThT binds fibrils and not non-beta oligomers
