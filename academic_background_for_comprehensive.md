Frequently used concepts (nice to have):

- affinity scale (add various markers for different drugs working at different affinities)
- time scale ( I like that chart which compares simulation timescale to biological time scale)
- how to interpret a 2D NMR spectra (for solid state NMR)
- memorize some common vocabulary (flash cards)


# Related concepts and general considerations (basically stuff that I haven't really understood and don't know how it would factor into my story)

Nov 13 2011 - ideas and concepts that came up in Sarah's thesis defense that may be relevant to me
- Better simulation water models
	- Tip4p Ew

- what about polarizability?

	- general argument for the force field being wrong
		- We get the same qualitative results ... we don't claim that what we get from simulations is quantitative.
			- But doesn't this defeat the purpose of doing simulations where we try to _quantitate_ physical events to the point of statistical convergence?
		- Sarah says that her results are essentially qualitative.
		
- Good and bad solvents <- I don't fully understand this idea.
	- I think these are just *phenomenological* terms that physicists label to different solution states that they don't fully understand what is going on at the molecular level.

- elastin peptide aggregation versus amyloid aggregation

- Relationship of the monomer conf eq to the aggregate ?
	- does the monomer predict the morphology of the aggregate or the behavior of the aggregate?
		- sarah's thesis show that it doesn't.  Suggests that may not be useful to study the monomer beyond the basic "I want to know how the monomer works".  People study the monomer because they can.  Even studying the monomer exhaustively was not feasible without the massive resources devoted.  
			- Something like the Abeta42 peptide is out of reach.
	
	- Protein space seem to be divided into elastin peptides, and peptides that form amyloid.  These two spaces are not mutually exclusive ... peptides can form ("get trapped") in a hydrated elastin like aggregate or proceed to amyloid depending on the solution properties (eg.  If solvated in methanol or water)

Note: protein aggregation is really a 4D problem that is a function of solvent, temperature, sequence, peptide length

- biomaterial applications - this is interesting ... can we take all of our data is use that for creating new biomaterials?
		

Sarah's defense questions:
- her committee
- boris
- ray kapral
- shekhar garde
- chris yip
- fred keely
- regis 

1) Why was MC not used?  
- MC is not good for use with explicit solvent?
- What are other reasons?
    - Sarah said she'd have to test that ...

2) Questions relating to experiments that were done on elastin under different experimental conditions and what the stress strain curve was tropoelastin?

3) Show that ST obeys detailed balance

Nov 29 2011
- I decided that I should download and read all of DE Shaw and Vijay Pande's papers.  I should follow closely all the people in the field that are pushing the boundaries and limitations of MD simulations.  
	- Are they doing a good job?
		- What kinds of questions are they going after?
	- How productive are they?
	- What kinds of methods are they using / Developing?
	- What could I do? What could we do? THINK BIG!
