Frequently used concepts (nice to have):

- affinity scale (add various markers for different drugs working at different affinities)
- time scale ( I like that chart which compares simulation timescale to biological time scale)
- how to interpret a 2D NMR spectra (for solid state NMR)
- memorize some common vocabulary (flash cards)
