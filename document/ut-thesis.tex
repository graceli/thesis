%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

%% ***   Add any desired options.   ***
\documentclass[draft]{ut-thesis}

%% ***   Add \usepackage declarations here.   ***


%% The line spacing of the document should be specified using one of
%% the document options given above, but if you need a line spacing
%% that is not provided by the options, you can override the default
%% line spacing for the entire document with the command
%%   `\linespacing{...}'.
%% Note that in order to get the correct appearance, the argument to
%% `\linespacing' must be equal to 1/3 + 2/3 times the desired line
%% spacing (for example, single-spaced = \linespacing{1},
%%                        1 1/2-spaced = \linespacing{1.33}, and
%%                       double-spaced = \linespacing{1.66}).

%% ***   Uncomment and fill in a value, if needed.    ***
%% ***   REMEMBER: You should NOT need to use this.  Use one of   ***
%% ***   the document class options mentionned above instead.     ***

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Currently, one method of targeting the underlying disease is to prevent or reverse the amyloid formation of A$\beta$42, a key pathological hallmark of AD. A small-molecule novel drug candidate, Scyllo-inositol, is a polyol small-molecule that exhibits stereochemistry dependent inhibition of the formation of fibrils in vitro.  Furthermore, recently completed phase II clinical trials demonstrated that scyllo-inositol achieved target drug levels in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimerâ€™s patients, a main challenge for AD drug candidates to to overcome. 
Despite its promise as a therapeutic for AD, the mechanism of action of scyllo-inositol at the molecular level is currently not understood.  We perform extensive microsecond timescale atomistic explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of scyllo-inositol and its inactive stereoisomer, chiro-inositol with the full length A$\beta$42 protofibril.  From our simulations, we predict binding affinities and characterize the binding modes of inositol and their stereochemistry-dependent effect on the structure of A$\beta$42 protofibrils.  Our results provide molecular insight for the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors of A$\beta$42 and other amyloid-based diseases.

First and foremost, I am grateful to my supervisor, Regis Pomes for his wisdom, insight, and guidance for the past 6 years of my life.

Secondly, I thank the members of my lab, both past and present, for all their moral support, and assistance with my work. 
I would like to thank the early members of the lab Drs. Chris Madill, Chris Neale, Sarah Rauscher and Tomas Rodinger for setting an example for me of how to be an excellent student of science. Not only were they brilliant scientists, they have provided the lab with invaluable insight, and technical expertise.

% advice and support which have had a profound influence on my perspective on life.
Nilu Chakrabarti, David Caplan, John Holyoake, Loan Huynh, Kethika K.

% Thank Mr. Zimmerman

% Thank Dr. Nasir Memon

% Thank SciNet & Team
% The computations presented in this thesis were resource intensive and I could not have accomplished any of it without generous allocations from the center for computational biology (CCB) at Sickkids and the following high-performance computing (HPC) consortia of Compute Canada: SciNet, SHARCNET, CLUMEQ, WestGrid, and RQCHP.
% My use of these computing resources was only possible because of the excellent support staff at each of these consortia. While there are perhaps one hundred people who have contributed to this thesis in this respect, I would like to mention some of those people who have provided exceptional levels of support.

Finally, I thank my mom and my grandparents for all of their support over the years. Without them I would not be here today.

%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep   %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files    %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the  %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'       %%
%%  instead of `\input' makes each chapter start on a new page.     %%
