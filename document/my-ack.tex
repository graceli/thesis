First and foremost, I am grateful to my supervisor, Regis Pomes for his wisdom, insight, and guidance for the past 6 years of my life.

Secondly, I thank the members of my lab, both past and present, for all their moral support, and assistance with my work. 
I would like to thank the early members of the lab Drs. Chris Madill, Chris Neale, Sarah Rauscher and Tomas Rodinger for setting an example for me of how to be an excellent student of science. Not only were they brilliant scientists, they have provided the lab with invaluable insight, and technical expertise.

% advice and support which have had a profound influence on my perspective on life.

% Thank Mr. Zimmerman

% Thank Dr. Nasir Memon

% Thank SciNet & Team
% The computations presented in this thesis were resource intensive and I could not have accomplished any of it without generous allocations from the center for computational biology (CCB) at Sickkids and the following high-performance computing (HPC) consortia of Compute Canada: SciNet, SHARCNET, CLUMEQ, WestGrid, and RQCHP.
% My use of these computing resources was only possible because of the excellent support staff at each of these consortia. While there are perhaps one hundred people who have contributed to this thesis in this respect, I would like to mention some of those people who have provided exceptional levels of support.

Finally, I thank my mom and my grandparents for all of their support over the years. Without them I would not be here today.
