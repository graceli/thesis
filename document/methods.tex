% From D. Caplan's thesis - Molecular mechanics (MM) is the empirical mathematical representation of atomic inter- actions in the classical limit. MM was developed over 50 years ago and has been applied to organic chemistry as a tool to estimate specific energetic properties of small molecules. Since then it has evolved into various functional forms (known as ìforce fieldsî) used to describe the potential energy of a system by computing atomic interactions. Force fields may vary in the way that they represent atomic particles to balance experimental accu- racy with computational efficiency. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a MM-based method in which force fields are used to calculate the position, velocity, and acceleration of atoms over time to produce a trajectory.

\section{Molecular Mechanics}
% Start by describing quantum mechanics 
% Assumptions and limitations of molecular mechanics
In an ideal world, one would be able to predict the evolution of a molecular system by solving the Schrodinger's equation, which predicts the t-evolution of all the atomic-nuclei and electronic motion.  However, to do so for a biomolecular system is extremely computationally-prohibitive, even for a very small molecule. REF

In the past decades, molecular mechanics, a classical mechanics approach, was developed to model and simulate a large system possible. In molecular mechanics, an empirical potential energy function (PEF) which depends only on the positions of atoms, is employed to describe the molecular energies of molecules. Simply put, molecules are treated as a set of masses connected by springs.

The underlying theoretical basis for molecular mechanics is rooted in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Under this approximation, electronic and nuclear motions are considered to be uncoupled, and therefore are treated separately. For this reason, the system's total energy (the Hamiltonian, $H$) only depends on the electronic motion, and the nuclei are assumed to be in fixed positions. 
% This is because the nuclei, which are much heavier than electrons, are typically fixed on the time scales of electronic vibration.

This potential energy function employed in molecular mechanics corresponds to the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface of the molecular system in its electronic ground-state. The movements of all atomic nuclei can be treated as a point charge in space, where the movement of electrons is implicitly accounted for in the specific form of the PEF and its associated parameter set, or force field.  Because electronically excited states are not treated, no chemical reactions occur in the system. However, although MM tells us nothing about electronic characteristics, its computational speed and its ability to deal with large systems makes it very attractive.

\section{Force Fields}

In the past four decades, a variety of functional forms have been developed, where each is optimized for a specific purpose have been developed for the purpose of modelling and simulating biomolecular systems. The functional form together with its associated parameters defines a \emph{force field}.

A typical empirical force field has many parameters to be determined.  These parameters are typically determined by fitting to quantum mechanical calculations, and to physical measurements (e.g., using data from X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction, vibrational raman spectroscopy) of small organic compounds or building blocks of peptides and nucleic acids.  Force fields are iteratively improved and extended by predicting experimentally observable quantities for small compounds, and adjusting parameters by comparing predicted quantities with experimental measurements.

Currently, many force fields for biopolymers such as peptides, proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates have been developed. Examples of these are the force fields AMBER, CHARMM, GROMOS, and OPLS. REFs  Although each force field have their variation of the PEF form, these force fields in general adopt the following general form:

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ff_general}
    V = V(bonds) + V(angles) + V(impropers) + V(dihedrals) + V(non-bonded)
  \end{equation}

\subsection{Bonded Interactions}
The first four terms of \ref{eq:ff_general}, $V(bonds)$, $V(angles)$, and $V(improper)$  are the functional terms used to describe bonded interactions and dynamics within a molecule.
These motions consists of covalent bond stretching, angle-bending, and torsional rotations.  It is important to note that bonds cannot be formed nor broken. 

Covalent bond stretching can be described using Hooke's Law for harmonic motion,
\begin{equation}
 V(bonds) = \sum_{bonds} k_b(b - b_0)^2.
\end{equation}

Similarly, angle-bending motions can be describing using a similar potential function,
\begin{equation}
V(angles) = \sum_{angles} k_{\theta}(\theta - \theta_{0})^2, \\
\end{equation}
where the constants $k_{b}$ and $k_{\theta}$ are the equilibrium force constants for bonds and angles, respectively, and $b_{0}$ and $\theta_{0}$ are the reference bond length and angle, respectively. Note that total energetic contribution from bond stretching and angle bending motions are computed by summing over all bonds and angles in the system.

\subsection{Non-bonded Interactions}
Non-bonded interaction potentials predominantly account for van der Waals and electrostatic forces.  These are important for the transferability of a force field, that is, the ability to reuse parameters created based on one molecule to predict properties of other molecules.  The non-bonded forces are only applied to atom pairs separated by at least three bonds. Van der Waals forces are represented by the Lennard-Jones potential,

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lj_function}
  V_{LJ}(r) = (\frac{r_{min}}{r})^{12} - 2(\frac{r_{min}}{r})^6
\end{equation}

The first term of \ref{eq:lj_function} is a repulsive force, and the second term is an attractive force at atomic distances where atomic shells overlap.  Here the constant $r_{min}$ is the preferred interaction distance for the atom pair or the van der Waals radii of atoms. Together these constitute a rapidly decaying function which represents a short-range attractive interaction that is characteristic of van der Waals forces. Parameterization of van der Waals potential to accurately reproduce these types of intermolecular interactions are typically challenging to determine because of the need for accurate reproduction of atomic radii, weak atomic attraction, and repulsive forces.
% Transferability (i.e., the ability to reuse parameters created based on one molecule to predict properties of another molecule 

Furthermore, the reproduction of electrostatics is paramount for describing interactions of polar and charged groups in biomolecules. To do so, an additive pairwise Coulombic potential is applied between all atom pairs which carry partial charges or charges at their nuclear centres.  The Coulombic potential, which depends on $r$, the distance between the pair of atoms, is given by

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:electrostatic}
  V_{coulombic}(r) = \frac{q_iq_j}{\epsilon r}, 
\end{equation}
where $q_{i}$ and $q_{j}$ are the point charges on atoms $i$ and $j$, respectively, and $\epsilon$ is the the permittivity of vacuum.  In contrast to van der Waals interactions,  electrostatic interactions are long-range interactions. Accordingly depicted in Figure XXX,  in comparisons to the Lennard-Jones potential, the Coulombic potential is a much slower decaying function, indicating that electrostatic effects are significant even up to distances of 1 - 1.5 nm.

 \label{fig:nonbonded_potentials}
\end{figure}

As previously discussed in Chapter 1 \ref{chap:introduction}, hydrogen bonding is an important type of electrostatic interaction and hence their proper representation must be captured by a force field.
Hydrogen bonding interactions are generally considered to be accounted for by the combination of van der Waals and electrostatic potentials.  However, an explicit term solely for describing hydrogen bonding may be employed by some force fields.  For example, the original AMBER force field introduced in 1984 added a function of the form $\sum_{hbonds} C_{ij}/R_{ij}^{12} - D_{ij}/R_{ij}^{10}$ to account for hydrogen bonds.\cite{Weiner:1984uw}  However, modern AMBER force fields do not utilize this explicit hydrogen bonding term.


% Other things that I will not be discussing -- what were they again?

\subsection{Electronic Polarizability}
Polarizability is the measure of the change in a molecule's electron distribution in response to an applied electric field, and is a property of matter which can be induced by electrostatic interactions with solvents or ionic reagents.  As discussed above, most current force fields use a fixed-charge model where each atom in the system is assigned a single value for the atomic charge.  This charge remains independent of changes in its local electrostatic environment. Next-generation force fields have been proposed to  incorporate models for electronic polarizability. REF However, because of the prohibitive computational cost associated with the use of these force fields, they have not been widely adopted by modern simulations.


% The introduction of polarizable force fields into common use has been inhibited by the high computational cost associated with solving this problem self-consistently.

\subsection{AMBER and OPLS Force Fields}
Here in this section, I will briefly discuss the AMBER and OPLS force fields in the context of protein simulations. The OPLS-AA and AMBER99 force fields were used to generate the results of this thesis presented in Chapters 3 to 5, and Chapter 6, respectively.  Detailed and extensive reviews of empirical force fields for protein simulations have been provided elsewhere.\cite{Ponder:2003uw,MackerellJr:2004p5558}

One of the first force fields developed for the simulations of proteins was the ... (AMBER) by XXX et al.
 
OPLS, short for optimized potentials for liquid simulations, was originally developed to simulate and reproduce liquid state properties with accuracy. These potential functions were first developed for ions and hydrocarbons,\cite{Jorgensen:1984vy} and then was later extended to amides and peptides.\cite{Jorgensen:1985wx} The non-bonded interactions in OPLS were derived by comparisons to liquid-state thermodynamics. In early OPLS development, a partial united-atom model was used whereby nonbonded interaction sites were placed only on non-hydrogen atoms and polar hydrogens.\cite{Jorgensen:1988vg,Jorgensen:1985wx,Jorgensen:1984vy}

A new all-atom OPLS force field (OPLS-AA) was developed for organic molecules and peptide simulations in 1996.\cite{Jorgensen:1996vx} Although XXX was performed for charge fitting and XXX calculation which were unique to t parameterization, the atom types and parameters for bonded interactions (bonds, angles, and dihedrals) were taken from the AMBER force field.

The general form of the force field potential energy function used in OPLS-AA is
  
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
          V = \sum_{bonds} k_b(b-b_0)^2 
          + \sum_{angles} k_{\theta}(\theta - \theta_{0})^2 \\
          + \sum_{dihedrals} k_{\chi}(1 + cos(n\chi - \delta)) 
          + \sum_{impropers} k_{\gamma}(\phi - \phi_{0})^2 \\
          + \sum_{nonbonded} \frac{q_1q_2}{er} \\
          + \sum_{nonbonded} \epsilon [(\frac{r_{min}}{r})^{12} - 2(\frac{r_{min}}{r})^6]
    \end{split}
  \end{equation}


\section{Molecular Dynamics Simulation}
% Approximations made in MD.
% Note the audience of your thesis.  It is good to cover basic ground.  I think I should also brief talk about enhanced techniques.
At a very high level, MD simulation is an algorithm to simulate motion of a system under the influence of a specific force field by following molecular configurations in time according to Newton's equation of motion. 

% This is the part with the time propagation using the Equations of motion
In a system of $N$ interacting particles, the force on each particle in the system is determined by taking the spatial derivative of the potential energy of the system, $V(r_{1}, r_{2}, ... , r_{N})$.  In MD simulations, this potential energy is approximated using a molecular mechanics force field as described above.  The force on each particle $i$ is given by
% Not exactly ... according to Chris Madill's thesis, U is the potential energy between an atom pair?  Clear up the core algorithm!
\begin{equation}
% F_i = - \nabla U
  F_i = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r_i}, i = 1, 2, 3, ... , N
\end{equation}
Here, the variable $r_{i}$ represents the spatial coordinates of the particle $i$. The calculated force vectors are summed together to yield the net force vector acting on every atom in the system. By Newton's second law of motion, the acceleration $a_i$ of each atom is given by 
\begin{equation}
a_i = \frac{F_i}{m_i},
\end{equation}
where $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$th particle. The position of $i$ at time $ t + \delta t$ is then
\begin{equation}
x_i(t + \delta t) = x_i(t) + v_i(t)\delta t + \frac{a_i(t)\delta t^2}{2}  
\end{equation}

To determine the positions of each of the N particles requires solving a system of 3N differential equations.  These equations are solved numerically by using a time-integration algorithm.  Once the positions for each particle are predicted, interatomic forces are updated based on these new coordinates, and the entire process is repeated again to obtain the coordinates of the system for subsequent time steps. To ensure numerical stability, a small integration time step in the range of 1 - 4 femtoseconds (fs) is chosen. REF Typically, in a MD simulation of a biomolecular system, a 2 fs timestep is used as it is twice the time period for the fastest vibrational motion (existing in bonds involving hydrogen). REF % [Ref: Chris Madill's and Tom's thesis]

% There are many different forms of integration algorithms, with the most common being the Verlet and leap-frog algorithms. 
% According to gromacs manual:
% md - is a leap-frog algorithm for integrating Newton's equation.
% Note that in absence of pressure and temperature coupling, verlet and leap-frog is equivalent ... and generates identical trajectories of motion.

% How much detail? Talk about the velocity verlet integration algorithm ? -- I'm going to study up on this but will eliminate this from my thesis ...


% Marty's thesis included a little bit on the verlet algorithm.  CN did not.

\subsection{Temperature and Pressure}
% My goal is to describe how temperature and pressure coupling is handled in MD at a high-level without going into the details of the math.
% Ref: Understanding Molecular Simulations by Frenkel Daan.
The inclusion of temperature in MD allows for the account of entropy in our systems, which is especially important for free energy determination. The equipartition of energy states that in a (classical) many-body system at thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom is related to the temperature via 
\begin{equation}
  \langle \frac{1}{2} mv_{\alpha}^2 \rangle =   \frac{1}{2} k_BT
\end{equation}

In a simulation, we use this equation as an operational definition of the temperature.  In practice, we would measure the total kinetic energy of the system and divide this by the number of degrees of freedom, $N_{r}$ in a system.  As the total kinetic energy of a system fluctuates, the instantaneous temperature of a simulation system is then

\begin{equation}
  T(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{m_iv_i^2(t)}{k_BN_f}
\end{equation}
 
In an experimental setting, temperature and pressure are often held constant.  To simulate a system under comparable conditions,  algorithms which implements a thermostat and a barostat (a virtual pressure piston) are used to hold temperature and pressure constant, respectively, in a simulation.  Several of these temperature- and pressure-coupling schemes have been developed and implemented. REF They are reviewed in detail elsewhere. REF 
% These algorithms have been validated to produce the correct statistical mechanical ensemble averages.

%Below is from the GROMACS manual:
% While direct use of molecular dynamics gives rise to the NVE (constant number, constant volume, constant energy ensemble), most quantities that we wish to calculate are actually from a constant temperature (NVT) ensemble. 
% Using the same idea, we can couple the system to a pressure bath.  This method is called the Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling, and the theory has been shown to correctly produce the NpT ensemble.

% Should I include the equations? I haven't seen this in other thesis, perhaps its too much detail. -- Yes this is too much detail.

%\subsection{Solvent Representation}
%% Talk about how solvent is accounted for
%The most realistic simulations treat the solvent environment by explicitly including the water molecules.  \textbf{How solvents are parameterized.  Can mention a few details about TIP3P water model. I actually don't know much about TIP3P} Solvent models are chosen to be consistent with the force field used for modelling the protein.  Although using explicit solvent leads to the most realistic simulations, these simulations are computationally expensive.  In some cases, instead of using explicit solvent molecules, implicit solvation can be used, that is the presence of solvent is approximated by using a potential. However, the implicit solvation suffers from several key weaknesses including a poor description of water-mediated interactions, directionality of water hydrogen bonds and only an approximate treatment of the nonpolar contribution to solvation.
%Hence,  is much less accurate and can introduce force field inconsistencies leading to inaccurate results.\cite{Yang:2013ff}

\subsection{Periodic boundary conditions}
Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) is a technique by which the central simulation cell (or ``box'') is replicated along each of its dimensions to form a system with infinite number of images.  PBC is used in MD simulations to alleviate artificial phase boundaries which are imposed by a finite simulation cell.  Furthermore, PBC allows the system to be treated as a bulk system, akin to that of an \textit{in vitro} experimental system.  To avoid counting duplicate interactions from multiple adjacent cells, an atom $i$ interacts with only another atom $j$, provided that $j$ is in $i$'s closest periodic images. Because of this constraint, care must be taken to chose a central box size large enough to avoid artificial interactions induced by periodic boundaries. REFS

\subsection{Theoretical underpinnings of MD simulations}
MD simulations yields information about the microscopic states of a macroscopic system characterized by thermodynamic variables such as the temperature, pressure, the number of particles, free energy, etc.   Thermodynamic variables are what is typically observed and measured experimentally.  Statistical mechanics is a body of theory that underpins the connection between the microscopic arrangements of a system to its thermodynamic properties.
 
Simulation systems are usually carried out in either canonical (NVT) or  isothermo-isobaric (NPT) ensembles. 
In an ensemble of microstates with constant number of particles, volume, and temperature, the NVT ensemble, the probability of finding a system in the microstate $i$, with an energy $E_{i}$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
p_{i} = \frac{1}{Z}e ^{\frac{-E_{i}}{kT}}
% Z = e ^{\frac{-A}{k_{B}T}}
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is the normalization factor (or the partition function), $Z = \sum_{i} e ^{\frac{-E_{i}}{kT}}$, so that $\sum_{i} p_{i} = 1$.

\textbf{Link this to the free energy. Then link this to NPT} NPT is fixed number of particles, constant pressure and temperature. This ensemble is the closest to experimental laboratory conditions, and hence simulations are often carried out in this fashion.

In the context of a biomolecular simulation, running an MD simulation yields a time-trajectory of motion of the molecules in the system, from which we can obtain time-averaged properties of the system.  However, in an experiment, the macromolecular observables measured are due to an average of all possible system configurations, or an \emph{ensemble average}.  This apparent conundrum is reconciled by one of the fundamental axioms of statistical mechanics, the ergodic hypothesis, which states that if a system is given long enough time to evolve, the time average of its macromolecular properties is equivalent to their ensemble averages.  In practice, this means that if a MD simulation sufficiently sampled the  phase space of a system, then experimentally-relevant properties may be calculated from such simulation.

% \textbf{This discussion is important ... but is not fitted well into the chapter.  Write what these ensembles are and link them to the simulations that is the pressure and temperature coupling schemes used }

\section{Practical Aspects of Preparing a Biomolecular System for MD Simulation}

Coordinates for the initial input into a simulation software need some care to be prepared.  First the structure of protein or peptide to simulated need to be generated.  The starting structure of the target protein is usually X-ray crystal or NMR structure, which can be taken from the Protein Data Bank.  Then the simulation environment is prepared to closely mimic the experimental conditions (usually experimental crystallization conditions). For example, the pKa of a protein is typically predicted so that residues such as histidine are appropriately protonated.

For a simulation of a globular protein, after the protein structure has been prepared, cosolutes, salt and water molecules are added to create the final simulation box. However, for more complex simulation systems, such as those in the presence of a lipid bilayer, additional steps
% Also make sure that at this point everyone in my committee understands that there is no ionization in the simulations and no chemical reactions.  
 
At this stage,  an energy minimization algorithm is usually performed on the system to correct any bad steric contacts that might have been introduced when solvent was added. An example of a completed starting structure of a simulation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_box}.

 \label{fig:simulation_box}
\end{figure}

Prior to performing production dynamics, which is what most of the results from a simulation will be based on, a short simulation to equilibrate the system is performed.  Equilibration is performed to allow the pressure and temperature of the system to stabilize. Here the stability of the protein is also validated to ensure that the protein structure has not grossly deviated (or unfolded) from the starting model.

%\section{Application of MD in structure-based drug discovery}
%
%% \1 (Why computational?) Can help us get protein dynamics is important for understanding protein function. We want to understand protein function because we want to be able to design drugs to cure diseases.
%
%% \1 A important application of MD simulation in biochemistry is the predicting of protein-ligand binding free energies.
%
%One application of MD simulations is in rational drug design. In recent years structure-based computer modeling of protein-ligand interactions have become a core component of modern drug discovery.  In early stage drug discovery, a target is identified along with putative binding sites.  Then, the structure of the target is determined using structural determination techniques such as NMR or X-ray crystallography.
%% [See Tom's thesis]
%Ligands which may act as potential drugs are expected to bind with a high affinity (low $K_d$) to the binding site. The goal is to discover,  high specificity inhibitors of a protein (usually an enzyme). In this process, the binding free energy of the ligand to its target is used to quantitatively evaluate how well a ligand binds. A crude estimate of the binding affinity can be obtained using computational docking methods, where the energetics of binding is typically estimated without accounting for either ligand or protein flexibility.  Although docking is fast, it is often inaccurate for identifying true drug candidates.
%
%With computer hardware becoming faster and cheaper, MD simulations can be used to rapidly prototype experimental ideas -- for example, one can perform computational alchemy, that is, ``mutate'' residues to test various hypotheses. Furthermore, simulations may be used to determine whether a chemical change will produce a more potent drug candidate. Currently, state of the art computational binding studies use MD simulations, where the protein and drug is allowed to relax and freely move about in the system. However, in the case of understanding a specific binding reaction often needed when developing an enzyme inhibitor, the ability to observe the relevant binding events is a low probability event on the timescale achievable by simulations. Therefore, a few enhanced techniques have been developed to accelerate this process.  They are briefly introduced below.

% Given the approximations of MD, MD is well-suited for probing the dynamics of complex systems on the timescale of picoseconds to seconds. ???

%Roughly speaking, one would like to run a simulation at least 10 times longer than the slowest important timescale in a system. Unfortunately, many biomolecular timescales exceed 1 ms, and in some cases by orders of magnitude (44).\cite{Zuckerman:2011dz} For molecular simulations to reliably predict, guide, and help explain experiment, these simulations require force fields of sufficient accuracy, adequate sampling of the relevant biomolecular motions (convergence) and a correct representation of the experimental conditions. Failures in any of these areas yield results which disagree with experiment.Until sampling is adequate, equilibrium properties computed from a simulation remain biased by the system’s starting state and no meaningful comparison with experiment is possible [6].

%\textbf{For molecular simulations to reliably predict, guide, and help explain experiment, these simulations require force fields of sufficient accuracy, adequate sampling of the rel- evant biomolecular motions (convergence) and a correct representation of the experimental conditions. Failures in any of these areas yield results which disagree with experiment. 
%
%We may be tempted to blame disagreement with experiment on just one of these areas—force fields are perhaps the most common scapegoat, sometimes with good reason [1–5]—but any or all of the three may be a weak point. And, in some sense, adequate sampling is the weakest link. 
%
%Until sampling is adequate, equilibrium properties computed from a simulation remain biased by the system’s starting state and no meaningful comparison with experiment is possible [6]. 
%
%With an inadequate force field or a poor representation of the experimental conditions, results will disagree with experiment, but will be robust and improvement is relatively easy, but not so with inadequate sampling.}

%\textbf{Achieving complete (or even adequate) conformational sampling is one of the key challenges in biomolecular simulations.\cite{Gnanakaran:2003vh} The energy landscape of most biomolecules is “rugged” and the source of this ruggedness is two-fold. The energetic barriers separating accessible states are often larger than the available thermal energy, and there are typically a large number of states to be sampled. The timescales of many biomolecular processes, such as protein folding, are still far beyond the reach of our current computational capability, which is generally limited to the 10-8-10-7 s timescale for continuous simulations. For example, even the folding of small domains or secondary structure elements, such as ?-hairpins and mini-proteins, occur on the 1-10 ?s timescale.1 
%
%Consequently, conventional or “brute force” molecular dynamics (MD) alone is often insufficient to achieve complete Boltzmann sampling of the important states of many biologically relevant systems. For this reason, generalized-ensemble algorithms have become popular tools for conformational sampling.}

% Topics that I'm not going to discuss
%Evaluating the convergence of simulations is still a challenge - I don't want to  go into this as this is out of the scope of my thesis.
%Limitations in the accuracy of current force fields - Don't talk about this .. but this will probably come up during the defense regardless.
