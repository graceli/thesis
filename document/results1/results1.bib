	Abstract = {A new model structure is proposed for the silk I form of the crystalline domains of Bombyx mori silk fibroin and the corresponding crystal form of poly(L-Ala-Gly). It was deduced from conformational energy computations on stacked sheet structures of poly(L-Ala-Gly). The novel sheet structure contains interstrand hydrogen bonds but is composed of anti-parallel polypeptide chains whose conformation differs from that of the antiparallel beta-sheets that constitute the silk II structure. The strands of the new sheet have a two-residue repeat, in which the Ala residues adopt a right-handed and the Gly residues a left-handed sheet-like conformation. The computed unit cell is orthorhombic, with cell dimensions a = 8.94 A, b = 6.46 A, and c = 11.26 A. The model accounts for most spacings in the observed fiber x-ray diffraction patterns of silk I and of the silk-I-like form of poly(L-Ala-Gly), and it is consistent with nmr and ir spectroscopic data. As a test of the computations, the well-established beta-sheet structure of silk II and the corresponding form of poly(L-Ala-Gly) have been reproduced. The computed energies for the two forms of poly(L-Ala-Gly) indicate that the silk-II-like form is more stable, by about 1.0 kcal/mol per residue. The main difference between the two structures is the orientation of the Ala side chains of neighboring strands in each sheet. In the Pauling-Corey beta-sheet and in the silk II form, referred to as an "in-register" structure, the Ala side chains of every strand point to the same side of a sheet. In the silk I structure, referred to as "out-of-register," the side chains of Ala residues in adjacent strands point to opposite sides of the sheet.},

	Abstract = {We determined the partial molar volumes and adiabatic compressibilities of N-acetyl amino acid amides, N-acetyl amino acid methylamides, N-acetyl amino acids, and short oligoglycines as a function of urea concentration. We analyze these data within the framework of a statistical thermodynamic formalism to determine the association constants for the reaction in which urea binds to the glycyl unit and each of the naturally occurring amino acid side chains replacing two waters of hydration. Our determined association constants, k, range from 0.04 to 0.39 M. We derive a general equation that links k with changes in free energy, DeltaGtr, accompanying the transfer of functional groups from water to urea. In this equation, DeltaGtr is the sum of a change in the free energy of cavity formation, DeltaDeltaGC, and the differential free energy of solute-solvent interactions, DeltaDeltaGI, in urea and water. The observed range of affinity coefficients, k, corresponds to the values of DeltaDeltaGI ranging from highly favorable to slightly unfavorable. Taken together, our data support a direct interaction model in which urea denatures a protein by concerted action via favorable interactions with a wide range of protein groups. Our derived equation linking k to DeltaGtr suggests that DeltaDeltaGI and, hence, the net transfer free energy, DeltaGtr, are both strongly influenced by the concentration of a solute used in the experiment. We emphasize the need to exercise caution when two solutes differing in solubility are compared to determine the DeltaGtr contribution of a particular functional group.},

	Abstract = {Structural insight into the conformational changes associated with aggregation and assembly of fibrils has provided a number of targets for therapeutic intervention. Solid-state NMR, hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mutagenesis strategies have been used to probe the secondary and tertiary structure of amyloid fibrils and key intermediates. Rational design of peptide inhibitors directed against key residues important for aggregation and stabilization of fibrils has demonstrated effectiveness at inhibiting fibrillogenesis. Studies on the interaction between Abeta and cell membranes led to the discovery that inositol, the head group of phosphatidylinositol, inhibits fibrillogenesis. As a result, scyllo-inositol is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of AD. Additional small-molecule inhibitors, including polyphenolic compounds such as curcumin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and grape seed extract have been shown to attenuate Abeta aggregation through distinct mechanisms, and have shown effectiveness at reducing amyloid levels when administered to transgenic mouse models of AD. Although the results of ongoing clinical trials remain to be seen, these compounds represent the first generation of amyloid-based therapeutics, with the potential to alter the progression of AD and, when used prophylactically, alleviate the deposition of Abeta.},

	Abstract = {Congo red is a commonly used histological dye for amyloid detection. The specificity of this staining results from Congo red{\&}apos;s affinity for binding to fibril proteins enriched in beta-sheet conformation. Unexpectedly, recent investigations indicate that the dye also possesses the capacity to interfere with processes of protein misfolding and aggregation, stabilizing native protein monomers or partially folded intermediates, while reducing concentration of more toxic protein oligomers. Inhibitory effects of Congo red upon amyloid toxicity may also range from blockade of channel formation and interference with glycosaminoglycans binding or immune functions, to the modulation of gene expression. Particularly, Congo red exhibits ameliorative effect in models of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer{\&}apos;s, Parkinson{\&}apos;s, Huntington{\&}apos;s and prion diseases. Another interesting application of Congo red analogues is the development of imaging probes. Based on their small molecular size and penetrability through blood-brain barrier, Congo red congeners can be used for both antemortem and in vivo visualization and quantification of brain amyloids. Therefore, understanding mechanisms involved in dye-amyloidal fibril binding and inhibition of aggregation will provide instructive guides for the design of future compounds, potentially useful for monitoring and treating neurodegenerative diseases.},

	Abstract = {We describe solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on fibrils formed by the 40-residue beta-amyloid peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease (Abeta(1-40)) that place constraints on the identity and symmetry of contacts between in-register, parallel beta-sheets in the fibrils. We refer to these contacts as internal and external quaternary contacts, depending on whether they are within a single molecular layer or between molecular layers. The data include (1) two-dimensional 13C-13C NMR spectra that indicate internal quaternary contacts between side chains of L17 and F19 and side chains of I32, L34, and V36, as well as external quaternary contacts between side chains of I31 and G37; (2) two-dimensional 15N-13C NMR spectra that indicate external quaternary contacts between the side chain of M35 and the peptide backbone at G33; (3) measurements of magnetic dipole-dipole couplings between the side chain carboxylate group of D23 and the side chain amine group of K28 that indicate salt bridge interactions. Isotopic dilution experiments allow us to make distinctions between intramolecular and intermolecular contacts. On the basis of these data and previously determined structural constraints from solid-state NMR and electron microscopy, we construct full molecular models using restrained molecular dynamics simulations and restrained energy minimization. These models apply to Abeta(1-40) fibrils grown with gentle agitation. We also present evidence for different internal quaternary contacts in Abeta(1-40) fibrils grown without agitation, which are morphologically distinct.},

@article{McLaurin:1998p176,
	Abstract = {A key pathological feature of Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease is the formation and accumulation of amyloid fibres. The major component is the 39 to 42 residue amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) which is an internal proteolytic fragment of the integral membrane amyloid precursor protein. Aggregation of Abeta into insoluble amyloid fibres is a nucleation-dependent event that may be modulated by the presence of amyloid-associated molecules. Fibril formation is also associated with neurotoxicity which may be the result of specific Abeta interactions with membrane proteins and/or lipids. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, tyrosine fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy, we have examined the binding of Abeta peptides 1-40 (Abeta40) and 1-42 (Abeta42) to the glycolipid, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and different inositol headgroups. At pH 6.0 and in the presence of PI vesicles, both Abeta40 and Abeta42 adopted an amyloidogenic beta-structure. In contrast, at neutral pH only Abeta42 folded into a beta-structure in the presence of PI vesicles. To determine whether the induction of beta-structure stemmed from interactions with the headgroup of PI, the effects of inositol derivatives on Abeta were also examined. At pH 7.0, myo-inositol was sufficient to induce beta-structure in Abeta42 but had no effect on the conformation of Abeta40. Myo-inositol may promote beta-structure as a result of its ability to be both a hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor. Mono-, di- and triphosphorylated forms of inositol had reduced ability to induce beta-structure in both peptides. The results from this study indicate that interaction of Abeta40 and Abeta42 with PI acts as a seed for fibril formation while myo-inositol stabilizes a soluble Abeta42 micelle.},

@article{Canchi:2011p53,
	Abstract = {Urea is a commonly used protein denaturant, and it is of great interest to determine its interaction with various protein groups to elucidate the molecular basis of its effect on protein stability. Using the Trp-cage miniprotein as a model system, we report what we believe to be the first computation of changes in the preferential interaction coefficient of the protein upon urea denaturation from molecular-dynamics simulations and examine the contributions from the backbone and the side-chain groups. The preferential interaction is obtained from reversible folding/unfolding replica exchange molecular-dynamics simulations of Trp-cage in presence of urea, over a wide range of urea concentration. The increase in preferential interaction upon unfolding is dominated by the side-chain contribution, rather than the backbone. Similar trends are observed in simulations using two different force fields, Amber94 and Amber99sb, for the protein. The magnitudes of the side-chain and backbone contributions differ in the two force fields, despite containing identical protein-solvent interaction terms. The differences arise from the unfolded ensembles sampled, with Amber99sb favoring conformations with larger surface area and lower helical content. These results emphasize the importance of the side-chain interactions with urea in protein denaturation, and highlight the dependence of the computed driving forces on the unfolded ensemble sampled.},

	Abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz.

	Abstract = {Using replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and united atom implicit solvent model we examine the role of backbone hydrogen bonds (HBs) in Abeta aggregation. The importance of HBs appears to depend on the aggregation stage. The backbone HBs have little effect on the stability of Abeta dimers or on their aggregation interface. The HBs also do not play a critical role in initial binding of Abeta peptides to the amyloid fibril. Their elimination does not change the continuous character of Abeta binding nor its temperature. However, cancellation of HBs forming between incoming Abeta peptides and the fibril disrupts the locked fibril-like states in the bound peptides. Without the support of HBs, bound Abeta peptides form few long beta-strands on the fibril edge. As a result, the deletion of peptide-fibril HBs is expected to impede fibril growth. As for the peptides bound to Abeta fibril the deletion of interpeptide HBs reduces the beta propensity in the dimers making them less competent for amyloid assembly. These simulation findings together with the backbone mutagenesis experiments suggest that a viable strategy for arresting fibril growth is the disruption of interpeptide HBs.},

	Abstract = {It has been more than 10 years since it was first proposed that the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be caused by deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in plaques in brain tissue. According to the amyloid hypothesis, accumulation of Abeta in the brain is the primary influence driving AD pathogenesis. The rest of the disease process, including formation of neurofibrillary tangles containing tau protein, is proposed to result from an imbalance between Abeta production and Abeta clearance.},

	Abstract = {The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cytosol and nucleus of neuronal cells leads to neurodegenerative disorders. Polyglutamine diseases are caused by polyglutamine-expanded proteins, whereas mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 lead to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These structurally unstable mutant species perturb essential interactions between normal proteins and tend to aggregate because of the presence of exposed hydrophobic surfaces. Accumulating evidence suggests that soluble species, including misfolded monomers and oligomers, are more toxic than large insoluble aggregates or inclusions. Spectroscopic analysis, including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence loss in photobleaching, in living cells revealed that protein aggregates of misfolded proteins are dynamic structures that interact with other proteins, such as molecular chaperones. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analysis detected soluble oligomers/aggregates of misfolded proteins in cell extracts. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis supported the notion that soluble oligomers/aggregates are formed before the formation of inclusions in vivo. Here, we reviewed the characteristics of oligomers and aggregates of misfolded proteins, with a particular focus on those revealed by spectroscopic analysis, and discussed how these oligomers may be toxic to cells.},

	Abstract = {The formation of well-ordered fibrillar protein deposits is common to a large group of amyloid-associated disorders. This group consists of several major human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion diseases, and type II diabetes. Currently, there is no approved therapeutic agent directed towards the formation of fibrillar assemblies, which have been recently shown to have a key role in the cytotoxic nature of amyloidogenic proteins. One important approach in the development of therapeutic agents is the use of small molecules that specifically and efficiently inhibit the aggregation process. Several small polyphenol molecules have been demonstrated to remarkably inhibit the formation of fibrillar assemblies in vitro and their associated cytotoxicity. Yet, the inhibition mechanism was mostly attributed to the antioxidative properties of these polyphenol compounds. Based on several observations demonstrating that polyphenols are capable of inhibiting amyloid fibril formation in vitro, regardless of oxidative conditions, and in view of their structural similarities we suggest an additional mechanism of action. This mechanism is assuming structural constraints and specific aromatic interactions, which direct polyphenol inhibitors to the amyloidogenic core. This proposed mechanism is highly relevant for future de novo inhibitors' design as therapeutic agents for the treatment of amyloid-associated diseases.},

	Abstract = {Protein misfolding and formation of beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils or aggregates is related to cellular toxicity and decay in various human disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Recently, we demonstrated that the polyphenol (-)-epi-gallocatechine gallate (EGCG) inhibits alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta fibrillogenesis. It associates with natively unfolded polypeptides and promotes the self-assembly of unstructured oligomers of a new type. Whether EGCG disassembles preformed amyloid fibrils, however, remained unclear. Here, we show that EGCG has the ability to convert large, mature alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta fibrils into smaller, amorphous protein aggregates that are nontoxic to mammalian cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that the compound directly binds to beta-sheet-rich aggregates and mediates the conformational change without their disassembly into monomers or small diffusible oligomers. These findings suggest that EGCG is a potent remodeling agent of mature amyloid fibrils.},

	Abstract = {In spiders soluble proteins are converted to form insoluble silk fibres, stronger than steel. The final fibre product has long been the subject of study; however, little is known about the conversion process in the silk-producing gland of the spider. Here we describe a study of the conversion of the soluble form of the major spider-silk protein, spidroin, directly extracted from the silk gland, to a beta-sheet enriched state using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Combined with electron microscopy (EM) data showing fibril formation in the beta-sheet rich region of the gland and amino-acid sequence analyses linking spidroin and amyloids, these results lead us to suggest that the refolding conversion is amyloid like. We also propose that spider silk could be a valuable model system for testing hypotheses concerning beta-sheet formation in other fibrilogenic systems, including amyloids.},

@article{Street:2006p21,
	Abstract = {Osmolytes are small organic compounds that affect protein stability and are ubiquitous in living systems. In the equilibrium protein folding reaction, unfolded (U) native (N), protecting osmolytes push the equilibrium toward N, whereas denaturing osmolytes push the equilibrium toward U. As yet, there is no universal molecular theory that can explain the mechanism by which osmolytes interact with the protein to affect protein stability. Here, we lay the groundwork for such a theory, starting with a key observation: the transfer free energy of protein backbone from water to a water/osmolyte solution, Deltagtr, is negatively correlated with an osmolyte{\&}apos;s fractional polar surface area. Deltagtr measures the degree to which an osmolyte stabilizes a protein. Consequently, a straightforward interpretation of this correlation implies that the interaction between the protein backbone and osmolyte polar groups is more favorable than the corresponding interaction with nonpolar groups. Such an interpretation immediately suggests the existence of a universal mechanism involving osmolyte, backbone, and water. We test this idea by using it to construct a quantitative solvation model in which backbone/solvent interaction energy is a function of interactant polarity, and the number of energetically equivalent ways of realizing a given interaction is a function of interactant surface area. Using this model, calculated Deltagtr values show a strong correlation with measured values (R = 0.99). In addition, the model correctly predicts that protecting/denaturing osmolytes will be preferentially excluded/accumulated around the protein backbone. Taken together, these model-based results rationalize the dominant interactions observed in experimental studies of osmolyte-induced protein stabilization and denaturation.},

	Abstract = {Osmolytes can have strong effects on biochemical reactions, such as protein folding or protein-ligand interaction. These effects are mediated through solvation-the nonspecific interaction between the solution components. Therefore, understanding the impact of osmolytes on cellular biochemistry requires an understanding of the underlying solvation processes. This chapter discusses the thermodynamic effects of osmolytes on proteins and small organic molecules in terms of the solvation of these molecules, as derived from Kirkwood-Buff theory. This approach allows experimental determination of solvation properties from thermodynamic data. Knowledge of solvation at this level provides insight into the observed behavior of proteins and small molecules in osmolyte solution on a microscopic level. As examples, we provide solvation effects on protein folding, ligand binding, and osmolyte thermodynamics.},

@article{Raman:2009p47,
	Abstract = {Using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and the implicit solvent model we probed binding of ibuprofen to Abeta(10-40) monomers and amyloid fibrils. We found that the concave (CV) fibril edge has significantly higher binding affinity for ibuprofen than the convex edge. Furthermore, binding of ibuprofen to Abeta monomers, as compared to fibrils, results in a smaller free energy gain. The difference in binding free energies is likely to be related to the presence of the groove on the CV fibril edge, in which ibuprofen tends to accumulate. The confinement effect of the groove promotes the formation of large low-energy ibuprofen clusters, which rarely occur on the surface of Abeta monomers. These observations led us to suggest that the ibuprofen binding mechanism for Abeta fibrils is different from that for monomers. In general, ibuprofen shows a preference to bind to those regions of Abeta monomers (amino terminal) and fibrils (the CV edge) that are also the primary aggregation interfaces. Based on our findings and on available experimental data, we propose a rationale for the ibuprofen antiaggregation effect.},

	Abstract = {The rational design of amyloid oligomer inhibitors is yet an unmet drug development need. Previous studies have identified the role of tryptophan in amyloid recognition, association and inhibition. Furthermore, tryptophan was ranked as the residue with highest amyloidogenic propensity. Other studies have demonstrated that quinones, specifically anthraquinones, can serve as aggregation inhibitors probably due to the dipole interaction of the quinonic ring with aromatic recognition sites within the amyloidogenic proteins. Here, using in vitro, in vivo and in silico tools we describe the synthesis and functional characterization of a rationally designed inhibitor of the Alzheimer's disease-associated beta-amyloid. This compound, 1,4-naphthoquinon-2-yl-L-tryptophan (NQTrp), combines the recognition capacities of both quinone and tryptophan moieties and completely inhibited Abeta oligomerization and fibrillization, as well as the cytotoxic effect of Abeta oligomers towards cultured neuronal cell line. Furthermore, when fed to transgenic Alzheimer's disease Drosophila model it prolonged their life span and completely abolished their defective locomotion. Analysis of the brains of these flies showed a significant reduction in oligomeric species of Abeta while immuno-staining of the 3(rd) instar larval brains showed a significant reduction in Abeta accumulation. Computational studies, as well as NMR and CD spectroscopy provide mechanistic insight into the activity of the compound which is most likely mediated by clamping of the aromatic recognition interface in the central segment of Abeta. Our results demonstrate that interfering with the aromatic core of amyloidogenic peptides is a promising approach for inhibiting various pathogenic species associated with amyloidogenic diseases. The compound NQTrp can serve as a lead for developing a new class of disease modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are considered as potential therapeutic agents against Alzheimer's disease. Using replica exchange molecular dynamics and atomistic implicit solvent model, we studied the mechanisms of binding of naproxen and ibuprofen to the Abeta fibril derived from solid-state NMR measurements. The binding temperature of naproxen is found to be almost 40 K higher than of ibuprofen implicating higher binding affinity of naproxen. The key factor, which enhances naproxen binding, is strong interactions between ligands bound to the surface of the fibril. The naphthalene ring in naproxen appears to provide a dominant contribution to ligand-ligand interactions. In contrast, ligand-fibril interactions cannot explain differences in the binding affinities of naproxen and ibuprofen. The concave fibril edge with the groove is identified as the primary binding location for both ligands. We show that confinement of the ligands to the groove facilitates ligand-ligand interactions that lowers the energy of the ligands bound to the concave edge compared with those bound to the convex edge. Our simulations appear to provide microscopic rationale for the differing binding affinities of naproxen and ibuprofen observed experimentally.},

	Abstract = {Elastin provides extensible tissues, including arteries and skin, with the propensity for elastic recoil, whereas amyloid fibrils are associated with tissue-degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. Although both elastin-like and amyloid-like materials result from the self-organization of proteins into fibrils, the molecular basis of their differing physical properties is poorly understood. Using molecular simulations of monomeric and aggregated states, we demonstrate that elastin-like and amyloid-like peptides are separable on the basis of backbone hydration and peptide-peptide hydrogen bonding. The analysis of diverse sequences, including those of elastin, amyloids, spider silks, wheat gluten, and insect resilin, reveals a threshold in proline and glycine composition above which amyloid formation is impeded and elastomeric properties become apparent.

	Abstract = {The capacity to form β-sheet structure and to self-organize into amyloid aggregates is a property shared by many proteins. Severe neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease are thought to involve the interaction of amyloidogenic protein oligomers with neuronal membranes. To understand the experimentally observed catalysis of amyloid formation by lipid membranes and other water-hydrophobic interfaces, we examine the physico-chemical basis of peptide adsorption and aggregation in a model membrane using atomistic molecular simulations. Blocked octapeptides with simple, repetitive sequences, (Gly-Ala)₄, and (Gly-Val)₄, are used as models of β-sheet-forming polypeptide chains found in the core of amyloid fibrils. In the presence of an n-octane phase mimicking the core of lipid membranes, the peptides spontaneously partition at the octane-water interface. The adsorption of nonpolar sidechains displaces the peptides' conformational equilibrium from a heterogeneous ensemble characterized by a high degree of structural disorder toward a more ordered ensemble favoring β-hairpins and elongated β-strands. At the interface, peptides spontaneously aggregate and rapidly evolve β-sheet structure on a 10 to 100 ns time scale, while aqueous aggregates remain amorphous. Catalysis of β-sheet formation results from the combination of the hydrophobic effect and of reduced conformational entropy of the polypeptide chain. While the former drives interfacial partition and displaces the conformational equilibrium of monomeric peptides, the planar interface further facilitates β-sheet organization by increasing peptide concentration and reducing the dimensionality of self-assembly from three to two. These findings suggest a general mechanism for the formation of β-sheets on the surface of globular proteins and for amyloid self-organization at hydrophobic interfaces.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid fibrils formed from different proteins, each associated with a particular disease, contain a common cross-beta spine. The atomic architecture of a spine, from the fibril-forming segment GNNQQNY of the yeast prion protein Sup35, was recently revealed by X-ray microcrystallography. It is a pair of beta-sheets, with the facing side chains of the two sheets interdigitated in a dry {\&}apos;steric zipper{\&}apos;. Here we report some 30 other segments from fibril-forming proteins that form amyloid-like fibrils, microcrystals, or usually both. These include segments from the Alzheimer{\&}apos;s amyloid-beta and tau proteins, the PrP prion protein, insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), lysozyme, myoglobin, alpha-synuclein and beta(2)-microglobulin, suggesting that common structural features are shared by amyloid diseases at the molecular level. Structures of 13 of these microcrystals all reveal steric zippers, but with variations that expand the range of atomic architectures for amyloid-like fibrils and offer an atomic-level hypothesis for the basis of prion strains.},

@article{Scaramozzino:2006p69,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease most closely correlates with the appearance of the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), intracellular fibrous aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein, tau. Under native conditions, tau is an unstructured protein, and its physical characterization has revealed no clues about the three-dimensional structural determinants essential for aggregation or microtubule binding. We have found that the natural osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) induces secondary structure in a C-terminal fragment of tau (tau(187)) and greatly promotes both self-aggregation and microtubule (MT) assembly activity. These processes could be distinguished, however, by a single-amino acid substitution (Tyr(310) --> Ala), which severely inhibited aggregation but had no effect on MT assembly activity. The inability of this mutant to aggregate could be completely reversed by TMAO. We propose a model in which TMAO induces partial order in tau(187), resulting in conformers that may correspond to on-pathway intermediates of either aggregation or tau-dependent MT assembly or both. These studies set the stage for future high-resolution structural characterization of these intermediates and the basis by which Tyr(310) may direct pathologic versus normal tau function.},

	Abstract = {Protein disorder is abundant in proteomes throughout all kingdoms of life and serves many biologically important roles. Disordered states of proteins are challenging to study experimentally due to their structural heterogeneity and tendency to aggregate. Computer simulations, which are not impeded by these properties, have recently emerged as a useful tool to characterize the conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. In this review, we provide a survey of computational studies of protein disorder with an emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of these studies. The application of simulation techniques to the study of disordered states is described in the context of experimental and bioinformatics approaches. Experimental data can be incorporated into simulations, and simulations can provide predictions for experiment. In this way, simulations have been integrated into the existing methodologies for the study of disordered state ensembles. We provide recent examples of simulations of disordered states from the literature and our own work. Throughout the review, we emphasize important predictions and biophysical understanding made possible through the use of simulations. This review is intended as both an overview and a guide for structural biologists and theoretical biophysicists seeking accurate, atomic-level descriptions of disordered state ensembles.},

	Abstract = {The accumulation of beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils or aggregates is a complex, multistep process that is associated with cellular toxicity in a number of human protein misfolding disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. It involves the formation of various transient and intransient, on- and off-pathway aggregate species, whose structure, size and cellular toxicity are largely unclear. Here we demonstrate redirection of amyloid fibril formation through the action of a small molecule, resulting in off-pathway, highly stable oligomers. The polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate efficiently inhibits the fibrillogenesis of both alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta by directly binding to the natively unfolded polypeptides and preventing their conversion into toxic, on-pathway aggregation intermediates. Instead of beta-sheet-rich amyloid, the formation of unstructured, nontoxic alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta oligomers of a new type is promoted, suggesting a generic effect on aggregation pathways in neurodegenerative diseases.},

	Abstract = {A key event in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease (AD) pathogenesis is the conversion of the peptide beta-amyloid (Abeta) from its soluble monomeric form into various aggregated morphologies in the brain. Preventing aggregation of Abeta is being actively pursued as a primary therapeutic strategy for treating AD. Trehalose, a simple disaccharide, has been shown to be effective in preventing the deactivation of numerous proteins and in protecting cells against stress. Here, we show that trehalose is also effective in inhibiting aggregation of Abeta and reducing its cytotoxicity, although it shows differential effects toward Abeta40 and Abeta42. When co-incubated with Abeta40, trehalose inhibits formation of both fibrillar and oligomeric morphologies as determined by fluorescence staining and atomic force microscopy (AFM). However, when co-incubated with Abeta42, trehalose inhibits formation only of the fibrillar morphology, with significant oligomeric formation still present. When aggregated mixtures were incubated with SH-SY5Y cells, trehalose was shown to reduce the toxicity of Abeta40 mixtures, but not Abeta42. These results provide additional evidence that aggregation of Abeta into soluble oligomeric forms is a pathological step in AD and that Abeta42 in particular is more susceptible to forming these toxic oligomers than Abeta40. These results also suggest that the use of trehalose, a highly soluble, low-priced sugar, as part of a potential therapeutic cocktail to control Abeta peptide aggregation and toxicity warrants further study.},

A combination of double-resonance IR-UV spectroscopy and quantum-chemical calculations has established the structures of complexes of the model, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine methylamide, bound to the α and β anomers of methyl D-gluco- and D-galactopyranoside as guests. In all cases, the carbohydrates are bound through hydrogen bonding to the dipeptide chain, although with some differing patterns. The amino acid host "engages" with the most suitable pair of neighboring conjugate sites on each carbohydrate; the specific choice depends on the conformation of the peptide backbone and the configuration and conformation of the carbohydrate ligand. None of the structures is supported by "stacking" interactions with the aromatic ring, despite their common occurrence in bound carbohydrate-protein structures.},

@article{Wu:2011p24,
	Abstract = {Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is a neutral derivative of the fluorescent dye Thioflavin T (ThT), which displays enhanced hydrophobicity and binding affinity to amyloid fibrils. We present molecular dynamics simulations of binding of PIB and ThT to a common cross-β-subunit of the Alzheimer Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). Our simulations of binding to Aβ(9-40) protofibrils show that PIB, like ThT, selectively binds to the hydrophobic or aromatic surface grooves on the β-sheet surface along the fibril axis. The lack of two methyl groups and charge in PIB not only improves its hydrophobicity but also leads to a deeper insertion of PIB compared to ThT into the surface grooves. This significantly increases the steric, aromatic, and hydrophobic interactions, and hence leads to stronger binding. Simulations on protofibrils consisting of the more-toxic Aβ(17-42) revealed an additional binding mode in which PIB and ThT insert into the channel that forms in the loop region of the protofibril, sandwiched between two sheet layers. Our simulations indicate that the rotation between the two ring parts of the dyes is significantly more restricted when the dyes are bound to the surface of the cross-β-subunits or to the channel inside the Aβ(17-42) cross-β-subunit, compared with free solution. The specific conformations of the dyes are influenced by small chemical modifications (ThT versus PIB) and by the environment in which the dye is placed.},

These crystalline properties permitted a molecular replacement approach based upon a beta-hairpin motif resulting in a structure of the fibrillar Abeta peptide. This detailed molecular structure of Abeta in its fibrous state provides clues as to the mechanism of amyloid assembly and identifies potential targets for controlling the aggregation process.},

	Abstract = {Abeta1-42 is a self-associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s pathogenesis. Neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. These neurotoxins comprise small diffusible Abeta oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. At cell surfaces, ADDLs bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. Germ-line knockout of Fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease, also was neuroprotective. Remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by ADDLs occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. Without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, ADDLs inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. We hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways.},

@article{Vandermeulen:2006p15,
	Abstract = {We describe the synthesis and self-assembly of two beta-sheet forming metallopolymer-peptide conjugates. The ability of the oligotetrapeptide sequence Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala (GAGA) to form antiparallel beta-sheets was retained in PFS-b-AGAG (PFS = polyferrocenylsilane) and PFS-g-AGAG conjugates with block and graft architectures, respectively. In the solid state, DSC experiments suggest a phase separation between the peptide and PFS domains. In toluene, PFS-b-AGAG interestingly forms a fibrous network which consists of a core containing the self-assembled antiparallel beta-sheet peptide and a corona of organometallic PFS. The self-assembly of the peptide into antiparallel beta-sheets is the driving force for the fiber formation, whereas PFS prevents uncontrolled lateral aggregation of the fibers. The use of an oligopeptide to self-assemble an otherwise random coiled organometallic polymer may be a useful strategy to enhance nanostructure formation. In the cases described here, the conjugates may be used to create nanopatterned ceramics, and the redox properties of the resulting supramolecular aggregates are of significant interest.},

These compounds have been previously identified as effective inhibitors of the Abeta self-assembly in their racemic form. Thioflavin-T Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy were applied to assess the potency of the chiral target compounds. Both enantiomers showed significant inhibition in the in vitro assays. The potency of the enantiomeric inhibitors appeared to be very similar to each other suggesting the lack of the stereospecific binding interactions between these small molecule inhibitors and the Abeta peptide.},

	Abstract = {Soluble oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) species are toxic to many cell types and are a putative etiological factor in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease. The NINDS-Custom Collection of 1040 drugs and biologically active compounds was robotically screened for inhibitors of Abeta oligomer formation with a single-site biotinylated Abeta(1-42) oligomer assembly assay. Several quinoline-like compounds were identified with IC(50){\&}apos;s {\&}lt;10 microM, including the antiprotozoal clioquinol that has been reported to have effects on metal ion metabolism. The 2-OH, 4-OH, and 6-OH quinolines do not block Abeta oligomer formation up to a concentration of 100 microM. Analogs of clioquinol have shown activity in reducing Abeta levels and improving behavioral deficits in mouse models of Abeta pathology. The inhibitory effects of clioquinol and other 8-OH quinoline derivatives on oligomer formation in vitro are unrelated to their chelating activity. Crosslinking studies suggest that clioquinol acts at the stage of trimer formation. These preliminary data may suggest that 8-OH quinolines have the potential for suppressing Abeta oligomer formation which should be considered when assessing the effects of these compounds in animal models and clinical trials.},

	Abstract = {Current research on inositols mainly focuses on myo-inositol (Ins) derivatives in eukaryotic cells, and in particular on the many roles of Ins phospholipids and polyphosphorylated Ins derivatives. However, inositols and their derivatives are more versatile than this--they have acquired diverse functions over the course of evolution. Given the central involvement of primordial bacteria and archaea in the emergence of eukaryotes, what is the status of inositol derivatives in these groups of organisms, and how might inositol, inositol lipids and inositol phosphates have become ubiquitous constituents of eukaryotes? And how, later, might the multifarious functions of inositol derivatives have emerged during eukaryote diversification?},

	Abstract = {scyllo-Inositol has shown promise as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease, by directly interacting with the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide to inhibit Abeta42 fiber formation. To explore the molecular details of the inositol-Abeta42 interaction, a series of scyllo-inositol derivatives have been synthesized which contain deoxy, fluoro, chloro, and methoxy substitutions. The effects of these compounds on the aggregation cascade of Abeta42 have been investigated using electron microscopy (EM). EM analyses revealed that the 1-deoxy-1-fluoro- and 1,4-dimethyl-scyllo-inositols significantly inhibit the formation of Abeta42 fibers. The other derivatives showed some alterations in the morphology of the Abeta42 fibers produced. These findings indicate the importance of all of the hydroxyl groups of scyllo-inositol for complete inhibition of Abeta aggregation.},

	Abstract = {The prion (infectious protein) concept has evolved with the discovery of new self-propagating protein states in organisms as diverse as mammals and fungi. The infectious agent of the mammalian transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) has long been considered the prototypical prion, and recent cell-free propagation and biophysical analyses of TSE infectivity have now firmly established its prion credentials. Other disease-associated protein aggregates, such as some amyloids, can also have prion-like characteristics under certain experimental conditions. However, most amyloids appear to lack the natural transmissibility of TSE prions. One feature that distinguishes the latter from the former is the glycophosphatidylinositol membrane anchor on prion protein, the molecule that is corrupted in TSE diseases. The presence of this anchor profoundly affects TSE pathogenesis, which involves major membrane distortions in the brain, and may be a key reason for the greater neurovirulence of TSE prions relative to many other autocatalytic protein aggregates.},

Such transitions can give rise to pathological conditions ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to systemic amyloidoses. In this review, we identify the diseases known to be associated with formation of fibrillar aggregates and the specific peptides and proteins involved in each case. We describe, in addition, that living organisms can take advantage of the inherent ability of proteins to form such structures to generate novel and diverse biological functions. We review recent advances toward the elucidation of the structures of amyloid fibrils and the mechanisms of their formation at a molecular level. Finally, we discuss the relative importance of the common main-chain and side-chain interactions in determining the propensities of proteins to aggregate and describe some of the evidence that the oligomeric fibril precursors are the primary origins of pathological behavior.},

	Abstract = {Soluble amyloid oligomers are a cytotoxic species in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease, and the recent discovery that trehalose can prohibit aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) has received great attention. However, its inhibition mechanism remains unclear. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibition effect, molecular dynamics simulations of Abeta(16-22) and Abeta(40) peptides at different trehalose concentrations (0-0.18 mol/L) are performed using an all-atom model. The simulations confirmed that Abeta(16-22) aggregation is prevented by trehalose in a dose-dependent manner, and it is found that the preferential exclusion effect of trehalose is the origin of its inhibition effects. Namely, there is preferential hydration on the peptide surface (3 A), and trehalose molecules cluster around the peptides at a distance of 4-5 A. At high trehalose concentrations, the preferential exclusion of trehalose leads to three sequential effects that prevent the nucleation and elongation of Abeta(16-22) oligomers. First, the secondary structures of Abeta(16-22) monomers are stabilized in the turn, bend, or coil, so the beta-sheet-rich structure that is prone to forming peptide oligomers is prevented. Second, the thin hydration layer and trehalose clusters can weaken hydrophobic interactions that lead to Abeta(16-22) aggregation. Third, more direct and indirect H-bonds form between trehalose and Abeta(16-22), which suppress the interpeptide hydrogen bonding. Analyses of the simulation data for a single Abeta(40) peptide indicate that trehalose can inhibit the nucleation and elongation of Abeta(40) by a similar mechanism with that on Abeta(16-22) oligomerization. The work has thus elucidated the molecular mechanism of trehalose on the inhibition of Abeta oligomeric aggregation.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid-beta (Abeta) assembly into fibrillar structures is a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease that is initiated by a conformational transition from random coil to beta-sheet and a nucleation-dependent aggregation process. We have investigated the role of organic osmolytes as chemical chaperones in the amyloid pathway using glycerol to mimic the effects of naturally occurring molecules. Osmolytes such as the naturally occurring trimethylamine N-oxide and glycerol correct folding defects by preferentially hydrating partially denatured proteins and entropically stabilize native conformations and polymeric states. Trimethylamine N-oxide and glycerol were found to rapidly accelerate the Abeta random coil-to-beta-sheet conformational change necessary for fiber formation. This was accompanied by an immediate conversion of amorphous unstructured aggregates into uniform globular and possibly nucleating structures. Osmolyte-facilitated changes in Abeta hydration also affected the final stages of amyloid formation and mediated transition from the protofibrils to mature fibers that are observed in vivo. These findings suggest that hydration forces can be used to control fibril assembly and may have implications for the accumulation of Abeta within intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and in vitro modeling of the amyloid pathway.},

@article{Rose:2006p35,
	Abstract = {Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder order transition called "folding." The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.},

@article{Gong:2003p22,
	Abstract = {A molecular basis for memory failure in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently hypothesized, in which a significant role is attributed to small, soluble oligomers of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta). A beta oligomeric ligands (also known as ADDLs) are known to be potent inhibitors of hippocampal long-term potentiation, which is a paradigm for synaptic plasticity, and have been linked to synapse loss and reversible memory failure in transgenic mouse AD models. If such oligomers were to build up in human brain, their neurological impact could provide the missing link that accounts for the poor correlation between AD dementia and amyloid plaques. This article, using antibodies raised against synthetic A beta oligomers, verifies the predicted accumulation of soluble oligomers in AD frontal cortex. Oligomers in AD reach levels up to 70-fold over control brains. Brain-derived and synthetic oligomers show structural equivalence with respect to mass, isoelectric point, and recognition by conformation-sensitive antibodies. Both oligomers, moreover, exhibit the same striking patterns of attachment to cultured hippocampal neurons, binding on dendrite surfaces in small clusters with ligand-like specificity. Binding assays using solubilized membranes show oligomers to be high-affinity ligands for a small number of nonabundant proteins. Current results confirm the prediction that soluble oligomeric A beta ligands are intrinsic to AD pathology, and validate their use in new approaches to therapeutic AD drugs and vaccines.},

	Abstract = {The study of organic osmolytes has been pivotal in demonstrating the role of solvent effects on the protein backbone in the folding process. Although a thermodynamic description of the interactions between the protein backbone and osmolyte has been well defined, the structural analysis of the effect of osmolyte on the protein backbone has been incomplete. Therefore, we have performed simulations of a peptide backbone model, glycine(15), in protecting osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) solution, in order to determine the effect of the solution structure on the conformation of the peptide backbone. We show that the models chosen show that the ensemble of backbone structures shifts toward a more collapsed state in TMAO solution as compared with pure water solution. The collapse is consistent with preferential exclusion of the osmolyte caused by unfavorable interactions between osmolyte and peptide backbone. The exclusion is caused by strong triplet correlations of osmolyte, water, and peptide backbone. This provides a clear mechanism showing that even a modest concentration of TMAO forces the protein backbone to adopt a more collapsed structure in the absence of side chain effects.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer disease is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta peptide into extracellular fibrillar deposits known as amyloid plaques. Soluble oligomers have been observed at early time points preceding fibril formation, and these oligomers have been implicated as the primary pathological species rather than the mature fibrils. A significant issue that remains to be resolved is whether amyloid oligomers are an obligate intermediate on the pathway to fibril formation or represent an alternate assembly pathway that may or may not lead to fiber formation. To determine whether amyloid beta oligomers are obligate intermediates in the fibrillization pathway, we characterized the mechanism of action of amyloid beta aggregation inhibitors in terms of oligomer and fibril formation. Based on their effects, the small molecules segregated into three distinct classes: compounds that inhibit oligomerization but not fibrillization, compounds that inhibit fibrillization but not oligomerization, and compounds that inhibit both. Several compounds selectively inhibited oligomerization at substoichiometric concentrations relative to amyloid beta monomer, with some active in the low nanomolar range. These results indicate that oligomers are not an obligate intermediate in the fibril formation pathway. In addition, these data suggest that small molecule inhibitors are useful for clarifying the mechanisms underlying protein aggregation and may represent potential therapeutic agents that target fundamental disease mechanisms.},

@article{Soto:2007p171,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder associated with the abnormal self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into fibrillar species. N-methylated peptides homologous to the central hydrophobic core of the Abeta peptide are potent inhibitors of this aggregation process. In this work, we use fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of the N-methylated peptide inhibitor Abeta16-20m (Ac-Lys(16)-(Me)Leu(17)-Val(18)-(Me)Phe(19)-Phe(20)-NH(2)) with a model protofilament consisting of Alzheimer Abeta16-22 peptides. Our simulations indicate that the inhibitor peptide can bind to the protofilament at four different sites: 1), at the edge of the protofilament; 2), on the exposed face of a protofilament layer; 3), between the protofilament layers; and 4), between the protofilament strands. The different binding scenarios suggest several mechanisms of fibrillogenesis inhibition: 1), fibril inhibition of longitudinal growth (in the direction of monomer deposition); 2), fibril inhibition of lateral growth (in the direction of protofilament assembly); and 3), fibril disassembly by strand removal and perturbation of the periodicity of the protofilament (disruption of fibril morphology). Our simulations suggest that the Abeta16-20m inhibitor can act on both prefibrillar species and mature fibers and that the specific mechanism of inhibition may depend on the structural nature of the Abeta aggregate. Disassembly of the fibril can be explained by a mechanism through which the inhibitor peptides bind to disaggregated or otherwise free Abeta16-22 peptides in solution, leading to a shift in the equilibrium from a fibrillar state to one dominated by inhibitor-bound Abeta16-22 peptides.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and amyloid formation are key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, and are considered to be two of the major contributing factors to neurodegeneration and dementia. Identification of small molecule inhibitors that are orally available, have low toxicity and high central nervous system bioavailability is one approach to the potential development of a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We have previously identified inositol stereoisomers as exhibiting stereospecific inhibition of Abeta aggregation and toxicity in vitro and in vivo. We report here the effects of inosose versus inositol stereoisomers on Abeta fibrillogenesis as determined using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy and negative-stain electron microscopy. The inososes differ from inositols by the oxidation of one of the hydroxyl groups to a ketone. These molecules help in the further elucidation of the structure-activity relationships of inositol-Abeta interactions and identify both allo-inositol and epi-2-inosose as in vitro inhibitors of Abeta aggregation.},

	Abstract = {Transport of large proteins into the nucleus involves two events, binding of the cargo protein to a transport receptor in the cytoplasm and passage of the cargo-transporter complex through the selective permeability barrier of the nuclear pore complex. The permeability barrier is formed by largely disordered polypeptides, each containing a number of conserved hydrophobic phenylalanine-glycine (FG) sequence motifs, connected by hydrophilic linkers of varying sequence (FG nups). How the motifs interact to form the permeability barrier, however, is not yet known. We have, therefore, carried out molecular dynamics simulations on various model FG repeat peptides to study the aggregation propensity of FG nups and the specific roles of the hydrophobic FG motifs and the hydrophilic linkers. Our simulations show spontaneous aggregation of the model nups into hydrated aggregates, which exhibit structural features assumed to be part of the permeability barrier. Our simulations suggest that short beta-sheets are an important structural feature of the aggregates and that Phe residues are sufficiently exposed to allow rapid binding of transport receptors. A surprisingly large influence of the amino acid composition of the hydrophilic linkers on aggregation is seen, as well as a major contribution of hydrogen-bonding patterns.},

	Abstract = {During the last 25 years, neuropathological, biochemical, genetic, cell biological and even therapeutic studies in humans have all supported the hypothesis that the gradual cerebral accumulation of soluble and insoluble assemblies of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in limbic and association cortices triggers a cascade of biochemical and cellular alterations that produce the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease (AD). The reasons for elevated cortical Abeta42 levels in most patients with typical, late-onset AD are unknown, but based on recent work, these could turn out to include augmented neuronal release of Abeta during some kinds of synaptic activity. Elevated levels of soluble Abeta42 monomers enable formation of soluble oligomers that can diffuse into synaptic clefts. We have identified certain APP-expressing cultured cell lines that form low-n oligomers intracellularly and release a portion of them into the medium. We find that these naturally secreted soluble oligomers--at picomolar concentrations--can disrupt hippocampal LTP in slices and in vivo and can also impair the memory of a complex learned behavior in rats. Abeta trimers appear to be more potent in disrupting LTP than are dimers. The cell-derived oligomers also decrease dendritic spine density in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, and this decrease can be prevented by administration of Abeta antibodies or small-molecule modulators of Abeta aggregation. This therapeutic progress has been accompanied by advances in imaging the Abeta deposits non-invasively in humans. A new diagnostic-therapeutic paradigm to successfully address AD and its harbinger, mild cognitive impairment-amnestic type, is emerging.},

	Abstract = {Inositol has 8 stereoisomers, four of which are physiologically active. myo-Inositol is the most abundant isomer in the brain and more recently shown that epi- and scyllo-inositol are also present. myo-Inositol complexes with Abeta42 in vitro to form a small stable micelle. The ability of inositol stereoisomers to interact with and stabilize small Abeta complexes was addressed. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that epi- and scyllo- but not chiro-inositol were able to induce a structural transition from random to beta-structure in Abeta42. Alternatively, none of the stereoisomers were able to induce a structural transition in Abeta40. Electron microscopy demonstrated that inositol stabilizes small aggregates of Abeta42. We demonstrate that inositol-Abeta interactions result in a complex that is non-toxic to nerve growth factor-differentiated PC-12 cells and primary human neuronal cultures. The attenuation of toxicity is the result of Abeta-inositol interaction, as inositol uptake inhibitors had no effect on neuronal survival. The use of inositol stereoisomers allowed us to elucidate an important structure-activity relationship between Abeta and inositol. Inositol stereoisomers are naturally occurring molecules that readily cross the blood-brain barrier and may represent a viable treatment for AD through the complexation of Abeta and attenuation of Abeta neurotoxic effects.},

@article{McLaurin:2000p76,
	Abstract = {Amyloid formation is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and is considered to be a major contributing factor to neurodegeneration and clinical dementia. Amyloid is found as both diffuse and senile plaques in the parenchyma of the brain and is composed primarily of the 40- to 42-residue amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. The characteristic amyloid fiber exhibits a high beta-sheet content and may be generated in vitro by the nucleation-dependent self-association of the Abeta peptide and an associated conformational transition from random to beta-conformation. Growth of the fibrils occurs by assembly of the Abeta seeds into intermediate protofibrils, which in turn self-associate to form mature fibers. This multistep process may be influenced at various stages by factors that either promote or inhibit Abeta fiber formation and aggregation. Identification of these factors and understanding the driving forces behind these interactions as well as the structural motifs necessary for these interactions will help to elucidate potential sites that may be targeted to prevent amyloid formation and its associated toxicity. This review will discuss some of the modulating factors that have been identified to date and their role in fibrillogenesis.},

	Abstract = {The synthesis and evaluation of a series of neutral analogues of thioflavin-T (termed BTA{\&}apos;s) with high affinities for aggregated amyloid and a wide range of lipophilicities are reported. Radiolabeling with high specific activity [(11)C]methyl iodide provided derivatives for in vivo evaluation. Brain entry in control mice and baboons was high for nearly all of the analogues at early times after injection, but the clearance rate of radioactivity from brain tissue varied by more than 1 order of magnitude. Upon the basis of its rapid clearance from normal mouse and baboon brain tissues, [N-methyl-(11)C]2-(4{\&}apos;-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (or [(11)C]6-OH-BTA-1) was selected as the lead compound for further evaluation. The radiolabeled metabolites of [(11)C]6-OH-BTA-1 were polar and did not enter brain. The binding affinities of [N-methyl-(3)H]6-OH-BTA-1 for homogenates of postmortem AD frontal cortex and synthetic Abeta(1-40) fibrils were similar (K(d) = 1.4 nM and 4.7 nM, respectively), but the ligand-to-Abeta peptide binding stoichiometry was approximately 400-fold higher for AD brain than Abeta(1-40) fibrils. Staining of AD frontal cortex tissue sections with 6-OH-BTA-1 indicated the selective binding of the compound to amyloid plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid. The encouraging in vitro and in vivo properties of [(11)C]6-OH-BTA-1 support the choice of this derivative for further evaluation in human subject studies of brain Abeta deposition.},
