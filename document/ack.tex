First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Regis Pomes, for his insight and guidance. My journey in scientific research begun in his lab in 2003 where I was a summer student.  I am grateful that I became older, wiser, and more confident in his lab under his guidance.

I thank the members of my lab, both past and present, for helping me with my work and for providing extensive moral support. Specifically, I would like to thank the early Ph.D. students of the lab, Drs. Chris Madill, Chris Neale, Sarah Rauscher, Tomas Rodinger and Marty Kurylowicz for setting examples of excellence. I especially thank Dr. Nilu Chakrabarti, Dr. John Holyoake, Dr. Chris Neale, David Caplan, Dr. Loan Huynh, Kethika K., and Aditi R. for their help, advice and support in life and in the lab. All of you have contributed substantially in helping me become more mature.

I would like to give my sincerest thanks to Mr. Larry Zimmerman, my high school math teacher and math team coach, and Dr. Nasir Memon for inspiring me and instilling in me a love of mathematics and computer science at a crucial age. You've also taught me the appropriate amount of discipline needed to study and master subjects in these fields.

I thank my family and friends both far and near for their support and encouragement (a.k.a had the patience to endure my venting over the years).  Thank you Ken, Omar and Yelena for all the good times I've had whenever I'm back in NYC and for your support and encouragement during stressful times. Thank you Mo, Henry and Andy, my old math team buddies from high school who also did their Ph.Ds, for helping me feel a sense of normality in being weird.

I give my deepest thanks to my mom and my grandparents for their unconditional love, support, encouragement, understanding, and belief in me.
