	Abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are filamentous aggregates of peptides and proteins implicated in a range of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It has been known almost since their discovery that these β-sheet-rich proteinacious assemblies bind a range of specific dyes that, combined with other biophysical techniques, are convenient probes of the process of amyloid fibril formation. Two prominent examples of such dyes are Congo red (CR) and Thioflavin T (ThT). It has been reported that in addition to having a diagnostic role, CR is an inhibitor of the formation of amyloid structures, and these two properties have both been explained in terms of the same specific noncovalent interactions between the fibrils and the dye molecules. In this article, we show by means of quartz-crystal microbalance measurements that the binding of both ThT and CR to amyloid fibrils formed by the peptide whose aggregation is associated with Alzheimer's disease, Aβ(1-42), can be directly observed, and that the presence of CR interferes with the binding of ThT. Light scattering and fluorescence measurements confirm that an interaction exists between these dyes that can interfere with their ability to reflect accurately the quantity of amyloid material present in a given sample. Furthermore, we show that CR does not inhibit the process of amyloid fibril elongation, and therefore demonstrate the ability of the quartz-crystal microbalance method not only to detect and study the binding of small molecules to amyloid fibrils, but also to elucidate the mode of action of potential inhibitors.},

@article{Inouye:1993ku,
	Abstract = {To elucidate the relation between amyloid fibril formation in Alzheimer disease and the primary structure of the beta/A4 protein, which is the major component of the amyloid, we have been investigating the ability of peptides sharing sequences with beta/A4 to form fibrils in vitro. In previous studies we focused on the macroscopic morphology of the assemblies formed by synthetic peptides corresponding in sequence to different regions of this protein. In the present study we analyze the x-ray diffraction patterns obtained from these assemblies. All specimens showed wide angle reflections that could be indexed by an orthogonal lattice of beta-crystallites having unit cell dimensions a = 9.4 A, b = 7 A, and c = 10 A, where a refers to hydrogen bonding direction, b to polypeptide chain direction, and c to intersheet direction. Given the amino acid sequence of beta/A4 as NH2-DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIAT-COOH, we found that, based on their orientation and assembly, the analogues could be classified into three groups: Group A, residues 19-28, 13-28, 12-28, 11-28, 9-28, 1-28, 1-38, 1-40, 6-25, 11-25 and 34-42; Group B, residues 18-28, 17-28, and 15-28; and Group C, residues 22-35 and 26-33. For Groups A and C, the sharpest reflections were (h00), indicating that the assemblies were fibrillar, i.e., elongated in a single direction. Lateral alignment of the crystallites in Group A account for its cross-beta pattern, in which the hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) direction is the fiber (rotation) axis. By comparison, the beta-crystallites of Group C had no preferential orientation, thus giving circular scattering. For Group B, the sharpest reflections were (h0l) on the meridian, indicating that the assemblies were plate-like, i.e., extended in two directions. A series of equatorial Bragg reflections having a 40 A period indicated regular stacking of the plates, and the rotation axis was normal to the surface of the plates. Of the Group A peptides, the analogues 11-28 and 6-25 showed intensity maxima on the equator as well as on higher layer lines, indicating that the beta-crystallites are highly ordered relative to one another in the axial, H-bonding direction. This sampling of the layer lines by a larger period (60 A) suggests that the beta-crystallites are arrayed either in cylindrical or small restricted crystalline lattices. Consistent with its electron microscopic images, we modeled the structure as a tube with five or six f,-crystallites constituting the wall and with the individual crystallite, which either rotates freely or is restricted, made of five or fewer beta-pleated sheets. For the Group B peptides, the electron density projection along the b-axis was calculated from the observed intensities using phase combinations from fl-keratin.Amino acid side-chain positions were apparent and, when refined as 4-A-diameter spheres, led to a substantial decrease in the R-factors.For peptide 18-28 the electron density peaks, which are thought to correspond to side chains, were centered 3.3 A from the peptide backbone, whereas for peptides 17-28 and 15-28, these peaks were centered 1 A or more further from the backbone. Peaks having high electron density faced peaks having lower density, suggesting a favorable stereochemical arrangement of the residues. Thus, our analysis of the fiber x-ray patterns from beta/A4 peptides shows the organization of the beta-crystallites that form the wall of the amyloid fibrils as well as possible side-chain interactions.},

	Abstract = {Protein disorder is abundant in proteomes throughout all kingdoms of life and serves many biologically important roles. Disordered states of proteins are challenging to study experimentally due to their structural heterogeneity and tendency to aggregate. Computer simulations, which are not impeded by these properties, have recently emerged as a useful tool to characterize the conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. In this review, we provide a survey of computational studies of protein disorder with an emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of these studies. The application of simulation techniques to the study of disordered states is described in the context of experimental and bioinformatics approaches. Experimental data can be incorporated into simulations, and simulations can provide predictions for experiment. In this way, simulations have been integrated into the existing methodologies for the study of disordered state ensembles. We provide recent examples of simulations of disordered states from the literature and our own work. Throughout the review, we emphasize important predictions and biophysical understanding made possible through the use of simulations. This review is intended as both an overview and a guide for structural biologists and theoretical biophysicists seeking accurate, atomic-level descriptions of disordered state ensembles.},

@article{Ehrnhoefer:2008fd,
	Abstract = {The accumulation of beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils or aggregates is a complex, multistep process that is associated with cellular toxicity in a number of human protein misfolding disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. It involves the formation of various transient and intransient, on- and off-pathway aggregate species, whose structure, size and cellular toxicity are largely unclear. Here we demonstrate redirection of amyloid fibril formation through the action of a small molecule, resulting in off-pathway, highly stable oligomers. The polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate efficiently inhibits the fibrillogenesis of both alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta by directly binding to the natively unfolded polypeptides and preventing their conversion into toxic, on-pathway aggregation intermediates. Instead of beta-sheet-rich amyloid, the formation of unstructured, nontoxic alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta oligomers of a new type is promoted, suggesting a generic effect on aggregation pathways in neurodegenerative diseases.},

@article{LeVine:2005cv,
	Abstract = {Although the structures of Thioflavin T and another benzothiazole, BTA-1, are similar, they bind to A beta non-competitively, probably to different sites on the A beta(1-40) fibrils. The amyloid fibril-induced fluorescence of ThT that corresponds to a fraction of total ThT binding is not displaced by high concentrations of (S)-naproxen or (R)-ibuprofen, which are reported to potently block high affinity binding of the radiolabeled malononitrile FDDNP and derivatives. The binding of the benzothiazole ligands is significantly substoichiometric with respect to A beta(1-40) monomer peptide, unlike Congo Red, which binds to A beta(1-40) fibrils on a 1:1 basis with monomer peptide. These results indicate that there are multiple domains for ligand binding to amyloid fibrils and suggest that it may be possible to design ligands that bind selectively to particular forms of fibrils that are connected with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and potentially other protein misfolding diseases.},

@article{Kim:2008ef,
	Abstract = {Aggregation of the amyloid beta (A beta) peptide plays a key role in the molecular etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Despite the importance of this process, the relationship between the sequence of A beta and the propensity of the peptide to aggregate has not been fully elucidated. The sequence determinants of aggregation can be revealed by probing the ability of amino acid substitutions (mutations) to increase or decrease aggregation. Numerous mutations that decrease aggregation have been isolated by laboratory-based studies. In contrast, very few mutations that increase aggregation have been reported, and most of these were isolated from rare individuals with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. To augment the limited data set of clinically derived mutations, we developed an artificial genetic screen to isolate novel mutations that increase aggregation propensity. The screen relies on the expression of A beta-green fluorescent protein fusion in Escherichia coli. In this fusion, the ability of the green fluorescent protein reporter to fold and fluoresce is inversely correlated with the aggregation propensity of the A beta sequence. Implementation of this screen enabled the isolation of 20 mutant versions of A beta with amino acid substitutions at 17 positions in the 42-residue sequence of A beta. Biophysical studies of synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences isolated by the screen confirm the increased aggregation propensity and amyloidogenic behavior of the mutants. The mutations were isolated using an unbiased screen that makes no assumptions about the sequence determinants of aggregation. Nonetheless, all 16 of the most aggregating mutants contain substitutions that reduce charge and/or increase hydrophobicity. These findings provide compelling evidence supporting the hypothesis that sequence hydrophobicity is a major determinant of A beta aggregation.},

@article{Hilbich:1992vy,
	Abstract = {The deposition of amyloid protein aggregates in brain is the main pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. Their principal constituent is a peptide termed beta A4, which comprises up to 43 amino acid residues. It is highly insoluble under physiological conditions and aggregates into filaments that form very dense clusters in vivo and in vitro. Based on a beta A4 prototype sequence spanning residues 10 to 42 or 43, we have designed analogues in which hydrophobic amino acid residues in position 17 to 20 were substituted by more hydrophilic residues. Depending on the kind of newly introduced amino acids and their position within the sequence, the substitution of only two residues led to variants exhibiting a broad spectrum of different properties. Common to them was a reduced beta-sheet content after solubilization in water and in the solid state. Some of the variants showed significantly reduced amyloidogenicity: although still forming filaments, they did not aggregate into the highly condensed depositions that are typical for amyloid. In addition, they could be solubilized in 200 mM-NaCl and KCl. When mixed with beta A4 peptides bearing the natural sequence, two of the analogues could inhibit the formation of filaments in vitro. These results demonstrate that a well-preserved hydrophobic core around residues 17 to 20 of beta A4 is crucial for the formation of beta-sheet structure and the amyloid properties of beta A4. The introduction of structural alterations within this region may guide the development of reagents for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.},

@article{Gordon:2001tj,
	Abstract = {A potential goal in the prevention or therapy of Alzheimer's disease is to decrease or eliminate neuritic plaques composed of fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta). In this paper we describe N-methyl amino acid containing congeners of the hydrophobic "core domain" of Abeta that inhibit the fibrillogenesis of full-length Abeta. These peptides also disassemble preformed fibrils of full-length Abeta. A key feature of the inhibitor peptides is that they contain N-methyl amino acids in alternating positions of the sequence. The most potent of these inhibitors, termed Abeta16-22m, has the sequence NH(2)-K(Me-L)V(Me-F)F(Me-A)E-CONH(2). In contrast, a peptide, NH(2)-KL(Me-V)(Me-F)(Me-F)(Me-A)-E-CONH(2), with N-methyl amino acids in consecutive order, is not a fibrillogenesis inhibitor. Another peptide containing alternating N-methyl amino acids but based on the sequence of a different fibril-forming protein, the human prion protein, is also not an inhibitor of Abeta40 fibrillogenesis. The nonmethylated version of the inhibitor peptide, NH(2)-KLVFFAE-CONH(2) (Abeta16-22), is a weak fibrillogenesis inhibitor. Perhaps contrary to expectations, the Abeta16-22m peptide is highly soluble in aqueous media, and concentrations in excess of 40 mg/mL can be obtained in buffers of physiological pH and ionic strength, compared to only 2 mg/mL for Abeta16-22. Analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrates that Abeta16-22m is monomeric in buffer solution. Whereas Abeta16-22 is susceptible to cleavage by chymotrypsin, the methylated inhibitor peptide Abeta16-22m is completely resistant to this protease. Circular dichroic spectroscopy of Abeta16-22m indicates that this peptide is a beta-strand, albeit with an unusual minimum at 226 nm. In summary, the inhibitor motif is that of alternating N-methyl and nonmethylated amino acids in a sequence critical for Abeta40 fibrillogenesis. These inhibitors appear to act by binding to growth sites of Abeta nuclei and/or fibrils and preventing the propagation of the network of hydrogen bonds that is essential for the formation of an extended beta-sheet fibril.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE:This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2 study explored safety, efficacy, and biomarker effects of ELND005 (an oral amyloid anti-aggregation agent) in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD).

METHODS:A total of 353 patients were randomized to ELND005 (250, 1,000, or 2,000 mg) or placebo twice daily for 78 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. The primary analysis compared 250 mg (n =84) to placebo (n =82) after an imbalance of infections and deaths led to early discontinuation of the 2 higher dose groups.

RESULTS:The 250 mg dose demonstrated acceptable safety. The primary efficacy analysis at 78 weeks revealed no significant differences between the treatment groups on the NTB or ADCS-ADL. Brain ventricular volume showed a small but significant increase in the overall 250 mg group (p =0.049). At the 250 mg dose, scyllo-inositol concentrations increased in CSF and brain and CSF Aβx-42 was decreased significantly compared to placebo (p =0.009).

CONCLUSIONS:Primary clinical efficacy outcomes were not significant. The safety and CSF biomarker results will guide selection of the optimal dose for future studies, which will target earlier stages of AD. Classification of evidence: Due to the small sample sizes, this Class II trial provides insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of ELND005.},

	Abstract = {Binding specificities of mouse macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin 1 (MGL1/CD301a) and 2 (MGL2/CD301b) toward various oligosaccharides were compared by frontal affinity chromatography. MGL1 preferentially bound oligosaccharides containing Lewis(X) (Le(X)) trisaccharides among 111 oligosaccharides tested, whereas MGL2 preferentially bound globoside Gb4. The important amino acids for the preferential bindings were investigated by pair-wise site-directed mutagenesis at positions 61, 89, 97, 100, 110-113, 115, 124, and 125 in the soluble recombinant carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) prepared in Escherichia coli and purified with galactose-Sepharose. Mutations of Val, Ala, Thr, and Phe at positions 61, 89, 111 and 125 on MGL1 CRD caused reductions in Le(X) binding. Mutations of MGL2 CRD at Leu, Arg, Arg, and Tyr at positions 61, 89, 115 and 125 were implicated in the preference for beta-GalNAc. Le(X) binding was observed with MGL2 mutants of Arg89Ala and Arg89Ala/Ser111Thr. MGL1 mutants of Ala89Arg and Ala89Arg/Pro115Arg showed beta-GalNAc bindings. Molecular modeling illustrated potential direct molecular interactions of Leu61, Arg89, and His109 in MGL2 CRD with GalNAc.},

The design of these receptors was inspired by the binding motifs observed in the crystal structures of protein-carbohydrate complexes. ¹H NMR spectroscopic titrations in competitive and non-competitive media as well as binding studies in two-phase systems, such as dissolution of solid carbohydrates in apolar media, revealed both highly effective recognition of neutral carbohydrates and interesting binding preferences of these acyclic compounds. Compared to the previously described acyclic receptors, compounds 4 and 5 showed significantly increased binding affinity towards β-galactoside. Both receptors display high β- vs. α-anomer binding preferences in the recognition of glycosides. It has been shown that both hydrogen bonding and interactions of the carbohydrate CH units with the aromatic rings of the receptors contribute to the stabilization of the receptor-carbohydrate complexes. The molecular modeling calculations, synthesis and binding properties of 4 and 5 towards selected carbohydrates are described and compared with those of the previously described receptors.},

@article{Nesmelova:2010ku,
	Abstract = {Galectins are a family of lectins with a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain that interacts with beta-galactosides. By binding cell surface glycoconjugates, galectin-1 (gal-1) is involved in cell adhesion and migration processes and is an important regulator of tumor angiogenesis. Here, we used heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling to investigate lactose binding to gal-1 and to derive solution NMR structures of gal-1 in the lactose-bound and unbound states. Structure analysis shows that the beta-strands and loops around the lactose binding site, which are more open and dynamic in the unbound state, fold in around the bound lactose molecule, dampening internal motions at that site and increasing motions elsewhere throughout the protein to contribute entropically to the binding free energy. CD data support the view of an overall more open structure in the lactose-bound state. Analysis of heteronuclear single quantum coherence titration binding data indicates that lactose binds the two carbohydrate recognition domains of the gal-1 dimer with negative cooperativity, in that the first lactose molecule binds more strongly (K(1)=21+/-6 x 10(3) M(-1)) than the second (K(2)=4+/-2 x 10(3) M(-1)). Isothermal calorimetry data fit using a sequential binding model present a similar picture, yielding K(1)=20+/-10 x 10(3) M(-1) and K(2)=1.67+/-0.07 x 10(3) M(-1). Molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into structural dynamics of the half-loaded lactose state and, together with NMR data, suggest that lactose binding at one site transmits a signal through the beta-sandwich and loops to the second binding site. Overall, our results provide new insight into gal-1 structure-function relationships and to protein-carbohydrate interactions in general.},

Hevein, a model lectin related to the superantigen family, recognizes the trisaccharide core of N-glycoproteins (1). A combined approach of NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling has permitted us to demonstrate that an Asn-linked Man(GlcNAc)(2) (2) is bound with even higher affinity than (GlcNAc)(3). The molecular recognition process entails conformational selection of only one of the possibilities existing for chitooligosaccharides. The deduced 3D structure of the hevein/2 complex permits the extension of polypeptide chains from the Asn moiety of 2, as well as glycosylation at Man O-3 and Man O-6 of the terminal sugar.

In addition, Glycan Reader is linked to other functional modules in CHARMM-GUI, allowing users to easily generate carbohydrate or glycoprotein molecular simulation systems in solution or membrane environments and visualize the electrostatic potential on glycoprotein surfaces.

@article{Duan:2002wa,
	Abstract = {The receptor, a maltose/maltooligosaccharide-binding protein, has been found to be an excellent system for the study of molecular recognition because its polar and nonpolar binding functions are segregated into two globular domains. The X-ray structures of the "closed" and "open" forms of the protein complexed with maltose and maltotetraitol have been determined. These sugars have approximately 3 times more accessible polar surface (from OH groups) than nonpolar surface (from small clusters of sugar ring CH bonds). In the closed structures, the oligosaccharides are buried in the groove between the two domains of the protein and bound by extensive hydrogen bonding interactions of the OH groups with the polar residues confined mostly in one domain and by nonpolar interactions of the CH clusters with four aromatic residues lodged in the other domain. Substantial contacts between the sugar hydroxyls and aromatic residues are also formed. In the open structures, the oligosaccharides are bound almost exclusively in the domain rich in aromatic residues. This finding, along with the analysis of buried surface area due to complex formations in the open and closed structures, supports a major role for nonpolar interactions in initial ligand binding even when the ligands have significantly greater potential for highly specific polar interactions.},

	Abstract = {Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is a neutral derivative of the fluorescent dye Thioflavin T (ThT), which displays enhanced hydrophobicity and binding affinity to amyloid fibrils. We present molecular dynamics simulations of binding of PIB and ThT to a common cross-β-subunit of the Alzheimer Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). Our simulations of binding to Aβ(9-40) protofibrils show that PIB, like ThT, selectively binds to the hydrophobic or aromatic surface grooves on the β-sheet surface along the fibril axis. The lack of two methyl groups and charge in PIB not only improves its hydrophobicity but also leads to a deeper insertion of PIB compared to ThT into the surface grooves. This significantly increases the steric, aromatic, and hydrophobic interactions, and hence leads to stronger binding. Simulations on protofibrils consisting of the more-toxic Aβ(17-42) revealed an additional binding mode in which PIB and ThT insert into the channel that forms in the loop region of the protofibril, sandwiched between two sheet layers. Our simulations indicate that the rotation between the two ring parts of the dyes is significantly more restricted when the dyes are bound to the surface of the cross-β-subunits or to the channel inside the Aβ(17-42) cross-β-subunit, compared with free solution. The specific conformations of the dyes are influenced by small chemical modifications (ThT versus PIB) and by the environment in which the dye is placed.},

	Abstract = {The self-aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils is a pathological hallmark of numerous incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. scyllo-Inositol is a stereochemistry-dependent in vitro inhibitor of amyloid formation. As the first step to elucidate its mechanism of action, we present molecular dynamics simulations of scyllo-inositol and its inactive stereoisomer, chiro-inositol, with simple peptide models, alanine dipeptide (ADP) and (Gly-Ala)(4). We characterize molecular interactions and compute equilibrium binding constants between inositol and ADP as well as, successively, monomers, amorphous aggregates, and fibril-like β-sheet aggregates of (Gly-Ala)(4). Inositol interacts weakly with all peptide systems considered, with millimolar to molar affinities, and displaces the conformational equilibria of ADP but not of the (Gly-Ala)(4) systems. However, scyllo- and chiro-inositol adopt different binding modes on the surface of β-sheet aggregates. These results suggest that inositol does not inhibit amyloid formation by breaking up preformed aggregates but rather by binding to the surface of prefibrillar aggregates.},

@article{Necula:2007p227,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer disease is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta peptide into extracellular fibrillar deposits known as amyloid plaques. Soluble oligomers have been observed at early time points preceding fibril formation, and these oligomers have been implicated as the primary pathological species rather than the mature fibrils. A significant issue that remains to be resolved is whether amyloid oligomers are an obligate intermediate on the pathway to fibril formation or represent an alternate assembly pathway that may or may not lead to fiber formation. To determine whether amyloid beta oligomers are obligate intermediates in the fibrillization pathway, we characterized the mechanism of action of amyloid beta aggregation inhibitors in terms of oligomer and fibril formation. Based on their effects, the small molecules segregated into three distinct classes: compounds that inhibit oligomerization but not fibrillization, compounds that inhibit fibrillization but not oligomerization, and compounds that inhibit both. Several compounds selectively inhibited oligomerization at substoichiometric concentrations relative to amyloid beta monomer, with some active in the low nanomolar range. These results indicate that oligomers are not an obligate intermediate in the fibril formation pathway. In addition, these data suggest that small molecule inhibitors are useful for clarifying the mechanisms underlying protein aggregation and may represent potential therapeutic agents that target fundamental disease mechanisms.},

@article{Chalifour:2003p161,
	Abstract = {Residues 16-20 of the beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) function as a self-recognition element during A beta assembly into fibers. Peptides containing this motif retain the ability to interact with A beta and, in some cases, potently inhibit its assembly. Replacing L- with D-amino acids could stabilize such peptides and permit their evaluation as therapeutic agents for Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease. Here we have assessed the effect that such a chiral reversal has on inhibitory potency. D-enantiomers of five peptides, KLVFFA, KKLVFFA, KFVFFA, KIVFFA, and KVVFFA, were unexpectedly more active as inhibitors in an in vitro fibrillogenesis assay. Circular dichroism showed that D-KLVFFA more effectively prevented A beta adopting the beta-sheet secondary structure correlated with fibrillogenesis. Electron microscopy showed that fiber formation was also more strongly inhibited by D-KLVFFA. Heterochiral inhibition was confirmed using D-A beta, on the principle that enantiomeric proteins exhibit reciprocal chiral biochemical interactions. With D-Abeta, L-KLVFFA was the more potent inhibitor, rather than d-KLVFFA. Most significantly, D-peptides were more potent at reducing the toxicity of both A beta1-40 and A beta 1-42 toward neuronal cells in culture. This unforeseen heterochiral stereoselectivity of A beta for D-peptide inhibitors should be considered during future design of peptide-based inhibitors of A beta neurotoxicity and fibrillogenesis.},

	Abstract = {Inositol has 8 stereoisomers, four of which are physiologically active. myo-Inositol is the most abundant isomer in the brain and more recently shown that epi- and scyllo-inositol are also present. myo-Inositol complexes with Abeta42 in vitro to form a small stable micelle. The ability of inositol stereoisomers to interact with and stabilize small Abeta complexes was addressed. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that epi- and scyllo- but not chiro-inositol were able to induce a structural transition from random to beta-structure in Abeta42. Alternatively, none of the stereoisomers were able to induce a structural transition in Abeta40. Electron microscopy demonstrated that inositol stabilizes small aggregates of Abeta42. We demonstrate that inositol-Abeta interactions result in a complex that is non-toxic to nerve growth factor-differentiated PC-12 cells and primary human neuronal cultures. The attenuation of toxicity is the result of Abeta-inositol interaction, as inositol uptake inhibitors had no effect on neuronal survival. The use of inositol stereoisomers allowed us to elucidate an important structure-activity relationship between Abeta and inositol. Inositol stereoisomers are naturally occurring molecules that readily cross the blood-brain barrier and may represent a viable treatment for AD through the complexation of Abeta and attenuation of Abeta neurotoxic effects.},

	Abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

@article{EsterasChopo:2008p219,
	Abstract = {The self-assembly of soluble proteins and peptides into beta-sheet-rich oligomeric structures and insoluble fibrils is a hallmark of a large number of human diseases known as amyloid diseases. Drugs that are able to interfere with these processes may be able to prevent and/or cure these diseases. Experimental difficulties in the characterization of the intermediates involved in the amyloid formation process have seriously hampered the application of rational drug design approaches to the inhibition of amyloid formation and growth. Recently, short model peptide systems have proved useful in understanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and amyloid formation using both experimental and theoretical approaches. Moreover, short D-peptide sequences have been shown to specifically interfere with those short amyloid stretches in proteins, blocking oligomer formation or disassembling mature fibrils. With the aim of rationalizing which interactions drive the binding of inhibitors to nascent beta-sheet oligomers, in this study, we have carried out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction of selected d-peptide sequences with oligomers of the target model sequence STVIIE. Structural analysis of the simulations helped to identify the molecular determinants of an inhibitory core whose conformational and physicochemical properties are actually shared by nonpeptidic small-molecule inhibitors of amyloidogenesis. Selection of one of these small molecules and experimental validation against our model system proved that it was indeed an effective inhibitor of fibril formation by the STVIIE sequence, supporting theoretical predictions. We propose that the inhibitory determinants derived from this work be used as structural templates in the development of pharmacophore models for the identification of novel nonpeptidic inhibitors of aggregation.},

In the first 80 years, very little progress was made in understanding the mechanisms that caused the brain to degenerate in a remarkably specific fashion (amyloid accumulation with neurofibrillary changes). Over the past 20 years, there has been an explosion of knowledge which continues today at an exponential rate. The molecular pathways underlying the synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease have delivered many validated therapeutic and diagnostic targets. A variety of therapeutic strategies aimed at disease modification are now in clinical development.},

	Abstract = {Fibrillogenesis of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a seminal pathogenetic event in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease. Inhibiting fibrillogenesis is thus one approach toward disease therapy. Rational design of fibrillogenesis inhibitors requires elucidation of the stages and kinetics of Abeta fibrillogenesis. We report results of studies designed to examine the initial stages of Abeta oligomerization. Size exclusion chromatography, quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy, and electron microscopy were used to characterize fibrillogenesis intermediates. After dissolution in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and removal of pre-existent seeds, Abeta chromatographed almost exclusively as a single peak. The molecules composing the peak had average hydrodynamic radii of 1.8 +/- 0.2 nm, consistent with the predicted size of dimeric Abeta. Over time, an additional peak, with a molecular weight {\&}gt;100,000, appeared. This peak contained predominantly curved fibrils, 6-8 nm in diameter and {\&}lt;200 nm in length, which we have termed {\&}quot;protofibrils.{\&}quot; The kinetics of protofibril formation and disappearance are consistent with protofibrils being intermediates in the evolution of amyloid fibers. Protofibrils appeared during the polymerization of Abeta-(1-40), Abeta-(1-42), and Abeta-(1-40)-Gln22, peptides associated with both sporadic and inherited forms of Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease, suggesting that protofibril formation may be a general phenomenon in Abeta fibrillogenesis. If so, protofibrils could be attractive targets for fibrillogenesis inhibitors.},

@article{Scrocchi:2002p178,
	Abstract = {Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is the major component of amyloid deposits found in the pancreas of over 90% of all cases of type-2 diabetes. We have generated a series of overlapping hexapeptides to target an amyloidogenic region of IAPP (residues 20-29) and examined their effects on fibril assembly. Peptide fragments corresponding to SNNFGA (residues 20-25) and GAILSST (residues 24-29) were strong inhibitors of the beta-sheet transition and amyloid aggregation. Circular dichroism indicated that even at 1:1 molar ratios, these peptides maintained full-length IAPP (1-37) in a largely random coil conformation. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed that co-incubation of these peptides with IAPP resulted in the formation of only semi-fibrous aggregates and loss of the typical high density and morphology of IAPP fibrils. This inhibitory activity, particularly for the SNNFGA sequence, also correlated with a reduction in IAPP-induced cytotoxicity as determined by cell culture studies. In contrast, the peptide NFGAIL (residues 22-27) enhanced IAPP fibril formation. Conversion to the amyloidogenic beta-sheet was immediate and the accompanying fibrils were more dense and complex than IAPP alone. The remaining peptide fragments either had no detectable effects or were only weakly inhibitory. Specificity of peptide activity was illustrated by the fragments, SSNNFG and AILSST. These differed from the most active inhibitors by only a single amino acid residue but delayed the random-to-beta conformational change only when used at higher molar ratios. This study has identified internal IAPP peptide fragments which can regulate fibrillogenesis and may be of therapeutic use for the treatment of type-2 diabetes.},

	Abstract = {All-atom simulations have been carried out on a monomer and dimer of the aggregation-prone fragment (16-22) of amyloid beta peptide, which is implicated in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease. The replica exchange molecular dynamics method, which has been successfully applied to peptide folding, is utilized as a means to sample the configurational space with proper Boltzmann weighting so that the structural, motional, and thermodynamic description of self-assembly can be obtained. The free energy landscape showing the delicate balance between different monomer and dimer conformations is mapped along carefully chosen reaction coordinates. The canonical ensembles at 38 different temperatures are used to describe the thermodynamics and the relative stabilities of at least six different dimer conformations including that of parallel and antiparallel orientations. We also delineate the nature of the molecular forces that activate and stabilize these different dimer conformations as a function of temperature, especially as related to secondary structural propensity of monomer. We identify parallel loop dimer conformations that are stabilized due to specific interactions with water molecules.},

	Abstract = {We report investigations of the morphology and molecular structure of amyloid fibrils comprised of residues 10-40 of the Alzheimer{\&}apos;s beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta(10-40)), prepared under various solution conditions and degrees of agitation. Omission of residues 1-9 from the full-length Alzheimer{\&}apos;s beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta(1-40)) did not prevent the peptide from forming amyloid fibrils or eliminate fibril polymorphism. These results are consistent with residues 1-9 being disordered in Abeta(1-40) fibrils, and show that fibril polymorphism is not a consequence of disorder in residues 1-9. Fibril morphology was analyzed by atomic force and electron microscopy, and secondary structure and inter-side-chain proximity were probed using solid-state NMR. Abeta(1-40) fibrils were found to be structurally compatible with Abeta(10-40): Abeta(1-40) fibril fragments were used to seed the growth of Abeta(10-40) fibrils, with propagation of fibril morphology and molecular structure. In addition, comparison of lyophilized and hydrated fibril samples revealed no effect of hydration on molecular structure, indicating that Abeta(10-40) fibrils are unlikely to contain bulk water.},

@article{Takeda:2010p52,
	Abstract = {Using replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and united atom implicit solvent model we examine the role of backbone hydrogen bonds (HBs) in Abeta aggregation. The importance of HBs appears to depend on the aggregation stage. The backbone HBs have little effect on the stability of Abeta dimers or on their aggregation interface. The HBs also do not play a critical role in initial binding of Abeta peptides to the amyloid fibril. Their elimination does not change the continuous character of Abeta binding nor its temperature. However, cancellation of HBs forming between incoming Abeta peptides and the fibril disrupts the locked fibril-like states in the bound peptides. Without the support of HBs, bound Abeta peptides form few long beta-strands on the fibril edge. As a result, the deletion of peptide-fibril HBs is expected to impede fibril growth. As for the peptides bound to Abeta fibril the deletion of interpeptide HBs reduces the beta propensity in the dimers making them less competent for amyloid assembly. These simulation findings together with the backbone mutagenesis experiments suggest that a viable strategy for arresting fibril growth is the disruption of interpeptide HBs.},

	Abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz. Its Web site is http://www.gromacs.org.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid fibril formation plays a role in more than 20 diseases including Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease. In vitro detection of these fibrils is often performed using Thioflavin T (ThT), though the ThT binding mode is largely unknown. In the present study, spectral properties of ThT in binding environments representing beta-sheet-rich and non-beta-sheet cavities were examined. Acetylcholinesterase and gamma-cyclodextrin induced a characteristic ThT fluorescence similar to that with amyloid fibrils, whereas beta-cyclodextrin and the beta-sheet-rich transthyretin did not. The cavities of acetylcholinesterase and gamma-cyclodextrin were of similar diameter and only these cavities could accommodate two ThT ions according to molecular modelling. Binding stoichiometry studies also showed a possible binding of two ThT ions. Thus, the characteristic ThT fluorescence is induced in cavities with a diameter of 8-9A and a length able to accommodate the entire length of the ThT ion. The importance of a cavity diameter capable of binding two ThT ions, among others, indicates that an excimer formation is a plausible mechanism for the characteristic fluorescence. We propose a similar ThT binding mode in amyloid fibrils, where cavities of an appropriate size running parallel to the fibril axis have previously been proposed in several amyloid fibril models.},

	Abstract = {When given orally to a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease, cyclohexanehexol stereoisomers inhibit aggregation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) into high-molecular-weight oligomers in the brain and ameliorate several Alzheimer disease-like phenotypes in these mice, including impaired cognition, altered synaptic physiology, cerebral Abeta pathology and accelerated mortality. These therapeutic effects, which occur regardless of whether the compounds are given before or well after the onset of the Alzheimer disease-like phenotype, support the idea that the accumulation of Abeta oligomers has a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid fibrils share various common structural features and their presence can be detected by Thioflavin T (ThT). In this paper, the binding mode of ThT to insulin amyloid fibrils was examined. Scatchard analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed at least two binding site populations. The binding site population with the strongest binding was responsible for the characteristic ThT fluorescence. This binding had a capacity of about 0.1 moles of ThT bound per mole of insulin in fibril form. The binding capacity was unaffected by pH, but the affinity was lowest at low pH. Notably, presence of a third binding process prior to the other processes was suggested by ITC. Binding of ThT resulted in only minor changes in the fibril structure according to the X-ray diffraction patterns, where a slightly more dominant equatorial reflection at 16A relative to the intersheet distance of 11A was observed. No change in the interstrand distance of 4.8A was observed. On the basis of our results, we propose that ThT binds in cavities running parallel to the fibril axis, e.g., between the protofilaments forming the fibrils. Such cavities have been proposed previously in insulin fibrils and several other amyloid fibril models.},

	Abstract = {Lectins are responsible for cell surface sugar recognition in bacteria, animals, and plants. Examples include bacterial toxins; animal receptors that mediate cell-cell interactions, uptake of glycoconjugates, and pathogen neutralization; and plant toxins and mitogens. The structural basis for selective sugar recognition by members of all of these groups has been investigated by x-ray crystallography. Mechanisms for sugar recognition have evolved independently in diverse protein structural frameworks, but share some key features. Relatively low affinity binding sites for monosaccharides are formed at shallow indentations on protein surfaces. Selectivity is achieved through a combination of hydrogen bonding to the sugar hydroxyl groups with van der Waals packing, often including packing of a hydrophobic sugar face against aromatic amino acid side chains. Higher selectivity of binding is achieved by extending binding sites through additional direct and water-mediated contacts between oligosaccharides and the protein surface. Dramatically increased affinity for oligosaccharides results from clustering of simple binding sites in oligomers of the lectin polypeptides. The geometry of such oligomers helps to establish the ability of the lectins to distinguish surface arrays of polysaccharides in some instances and to crosslink glycoconjugates in others.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics and thermodynamics character of H1 peptide in aqueous solution has been investigated through temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (T-REMD) simulations using two different force fields (OPLS-AA and GROMOS 43A1). The two independent T-REMD simulations were completed starting from initial conformations alpha-helix and beta-sheet, respectively. Each replica was run for 300 ns. The performance of each force field was assessed from the parameters such as the distributions of backbone dihedral angles, the number of native hydrogen bond, root mean square deviations (RMSD) of C(alpha) atoms and all heavy atoms, formation of beta-turn, the stability of folded beta-hairpin structure and the favorite conformations of different force fields. The simulation using GROMOS 43A1 force field starting from alpha-helix structure sampled the conformation cluster which C(alpha) RMSD was 0.05 nm from beta-sheet structure and the cluster contains 39% of all conformations. The simulation using OPLS-AA force field produced more sampling in P(II)region than in GROMOS 43A1 force field. The both force field simulations produced some sampling in the alpha region, but the probabilities of the conformations including any helical content were only 1-2%. Under the both force fields, the beta-turn structures exhibited higher stability than alpha-helix structures and the folded beta-hairpin structures. In the GROMOS 43A1 force field, the free energy change from the unfolded state to the hairpin state was in good agreement with the results of several experiments about some beta-peptides (not the H1 peptide) and the other molecular dynamics simulations of H1 peptide. However, the folded beta-hairpin structure was more destabilized in the OPLS-AA force field than in the GROMOS 43A1 force field and experiments.},

	Abstract = {This review considers the design, synthesis, and mechanistic assessment of peptide-based fibrillogenesis inhibitors, mainly focusing on beta-amyloid, but generalizable to other aggregating proteins and peptides. In spite of revision of the {\&}quot;amyloid hypothesis,{\&}quot; the investigation and development of fibrillogenesis inhibitors remain important scientific and therapeutic goals for at least three reasons. First, it is still premature to dismiss fibrils altogether as sources of cytotoxicity. Second, a {\&}quot;fibrillogenesis inhibitor{\&}quot; is typically identified experimentally as such, but these compounds may also bind to intermediates in the fibrillogenesis pathway and have hard-to-predict consequences, including improved clearance of more cytotoxic soluble oligomers. Third, inhibitors are valuable structural probes, as the entire field of enzymology attests. Screening procedures for selection of random inhibitory sequences are briefly considered, but the bulk of the review concentrates on rationally designed fibrillogenesis inhibitors. Among these are internal segments of fibril-forming peptides, amino acid substitutions and side chain modifications of fibrillogenic domains, insertion of prolines into or adjacent to fibrillogenic domains, modification of peptide termini, modification of peptide backbone atoms (including N-methylation), peptide cyclization, use of D-amino acids in fibrillogenic domains, and nonpeptidic beta-sheet mimics. Finally, we consider methods of assaying fibrillogenesis inhibitors, including pitfalls in these assays. We consider binding of inhibitor peptides to their targets, but because this is a specific application of the more general and much larger problem of assessing protein-protein interactions, this topic is covered only briefly. Finally, we consider potential applications of inhibitor peptides to therapeutic strategies.},

	Abstract = {Carbohydrate binding sites are considered important for cellular recognition and adhesion and are important targets for drug design. In this paper we present a new method called InCa-SiteFinder for predicting non-covalent inositol and carbohydrate binding sites on the surface of protein structures. It uses the van der Waals energy of a protein-probe interaction and amino acid propensities to locate and predict carbohydrate binding sites. The protein surface is searched for continuous volume envelopes that correspond to a favorable protein-probe interaction. These volumes are subsequently analyzed to demarcate regions of high cumulative propensity for binding a carbohydrate moiety based on calculated amino acid propensity scores. InCa-SiteFinder(1) was tested on an independent test set of 80 protein-ligand complexes. It efficiently identifies carbohydrate binding sites with high specificity and sensitivity. It was also tested on a second test set of 80 protein-ligand complexes containing 40 known carbohydrate binders (having 40 carbohydrate binding sites) and 40 known drug-like compound binders (having 58 known drug-like compound binding sites) for the prediction of the location of the carbohydrate binding sites and to distinguish these from the drug-like compound binding sites. At 73% sensitivity the method showed 98% specificity. Almost all of the carbohydrate and drug-like compound binding sites were correctly identified with an overall error rate of 12%.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is the largest unmet medical need in neurology. Current drugs improve symptoms, but do not have profound disease-modifying effects. However, in recent years, several approaches aimed at inhibiting disease progression have advanced to clinical trials. Among these, strategies targeting the production and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide - a cardinal feature of Alzheimer's disease that is thought to be important in disease pathogenesis - are the most advanced. Approaches aimed at modulating the abnormal aggregation of tau filaments (another key feature of the disease), and those targeting metabolic dysfunction, are also being evaluated in the clinic. This article discusses recent progress with each of these strategies, with a focus on anti-amyloid strategies, highlighting the lessons learned and the challenges that remain.},

@article{Janus:2000p198,
	Abstract = {Much evidence indicates that abnormal processing and extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (A beta), a proteolytic derivative of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP), is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in ref. 1). In the PDAPP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, immunization with A beta causes a marked reduction in burden of the brain amyloid. Evidence that A beta immunization also reduces cognitive dysfunction in murine models of Alzheimer's disease would support the hypothesis that abnormal A beta processing is essential to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and would encourage the development of other strategies directed at the 'amyloid cascade'. Here we show that A beta immunization reduces both deposition of cerebral fibrillar A beta and cognitive dysfunction in the TgCRND8 murine model of Alzheimer's disease without, however, altering total levels of A beta in the brain. This implies that either a approximately 50% reduction in dense-cored A beta plaques is sufficient to affect cognition, or that vaccination may modulate the activity/abundance of a small subpopulation of especially toxic A beta species.},

	Abstract = {Elastin provides extensible tissues, including arteries and skin, with the propensity for elastic recoil, whereas amyloid fibrils are associated with tissue-degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. Although both elastin-like and amyloid-like materials result from the self-organization of proteins into fibrils, the molecular basis of their differing physical properties is poorly understood. Using molecular simulations of monomeric and aggregated states, we demonstrate that elastin-like and amyloid-like peptides are separable on the basis of backbone hydration and peptide-peptide hydrogen bonding. The analysis of diverse sequences, including those of elastin, amyloids, spider silks, wheat gluten, and insect resilin, reveals a threshold in proline and glycine composition above which amyloid formation is impeded and elastomeric properties become apparent. The predictive capacity of this threshold is confirmed by the self-assembly of recombinant peptides into either amyloid or elastin-like fibrils. Our findings support a unified model of protein aggregation in which hydration and conformational disorder are fundamental requirements for elastomeric function.},

	Abstract = {Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are considered as potential therapeutic agents against Alzheimer's disease. Using replica exchange molecular dynamics and atomistic implicit solvent model, we studied the mechanisms of binding of naproxen and ibuprofen to the Abeta fibril derived from solid-state NMR measurements. The binding temperature of naproxen is found to be almost 40 K higher than of ibuprofen implicating higher binding affinity of naproxen. The key factor, which enhances naproxen binding, is strong interactions between ligands bound to the surface of the fibril. The naphthalene ring in naproxen appears to provide a dominant contribution to ligand-ligand interactions. In contrast, ligand-fibril interactions cannot explain differences in the binding affinities of naproxen and ibuprofen. The concave fibril edge with the groove is identified as the primary binding location for both ligands. We show that confinement of the ligands to the groove facilitates ligand-ligand interactions that lowers the energy of the ligands bound to the concave edge compared with those bound to the convex edge. Our simulations appear to provide microscopic rationale for the differing binding affinities of naproxen and ibuprofen observed experimentally.},

@article{Raman:2009p47,
	Abstract = {Using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and the implicit solvent model we probed binding of ibuprofen to Abeta(10-40) monomers and amyloid fibrils. We found that the concave (CV) fibril edge has significantly higher binding affinity for ibuprofen than the convex edge. Furthermore, binding of ibuprofen to Abeta monomers, as compared to fibrils, results in a smaller free energy gain. The difference in binding free energies is likely to be related to the presence of the groove on the CV fibril edge, in which ibuprofen tends to accumulate. The confinement effect of the groove promotes the formation of large low-energy ibuprofen clusters, which rarely occur on the surface of Abeta monomers. These observations led us to suggest that the ibuprofen binding mechanism for Abeta fibrils is different from that for monomers. In general, ibuprofen shows a preference to bind to those regions of Abeta monomers (amino terminal) and fibrils (the CV edge) that are also the primary aggregation interfaces. Based on our findings and on available experimental data, we propose a rationale for the ibuprofen antiaggregation effect.},

@article{Luhrs:2005p229,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is the most fatal neurodegenerative disorder wherein the process of amyloid-beta (Abeta) amyloidogenesis appears causative. Here, we present the 3D structure of the fibrils comprising Abeta(1-42), which was obtained by using hydrogen-bonding constraints from quenched hydrogen/deuterium-exchange NMR, side-chain packing constraints from pairwise mutagenesis studies, and parallel, in-register beta-sheet arrangement from previous solid-state NMR studies. Although residues 1-17 are disordered, residues 18-42 form a beta-strand-turn-beta-strand motif that contains two intermolecular, parallel, in-register beta-sheets that are formed by residues 18-26 (beta1) and 31-42 (beta2). At least two molecules of Abeta(1-42) are required to achieve the repeating structure of a protofilament. Intermolecular side-chain contacts are formed between the odd-numbered residues of strand beta1 of the nth molecule and the even-numbered residues of strand beta2 of the (n - 1)th molecule. This interaction pattern leads to partially unpaired beta-strands at the fibrillar ends, which explains the sequence selectivity, the cooperativity, and the apparent unidirectionality of Abeta fibril growth. It also provides a structural basis for fibrillization inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid fibrils formed from different proteins, each associated with a particular disease, contain a common cross-beta spine. The atomic architecture of a spine, from the fibril-forming segment GNNQQNY of the yeast prion protein Sup35, was recently revealed by X-ray microcrystallography. It is a pair of beta-sheets, with the facing side chains of the two sheets interdigitated in a dry {\&}apos;steric zipper{\&}apos;. Here we report some 30 other segments from fibril-forming proteins that form amyloid-like fibrils, microcrystals, or usually both. These include segments from the Alzheimer{\&}apos;s amyloid-beta and tau proteins, the PrP prion protein, insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), lysozyme, myoglobin, alpha-synuclein and beta(2)-microglobulin, suggesting that common structural features are shared by amyloid diseases at the molecular level. Structures of 13 of these microcrystals all reveal steric zippers, but with variations that expand the range of atomic architectures for amyloid-like fibrils and offer an atomic-level hypothesis for the basis of prion strains.},

	Abstract = {Structural insight into the conformational changes associated with aggregation and assembly of fibrils has provided a number of targets for therapeutic intervention. Solid-state NMR, hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mutagenesis strategies have been used to probe the secondary and tertiary structure of amyloid fibrils and key intermediates. Rational design of peptide inhibitors directed against key residues important for aggregation and stabilization of fibrils has demonstrated effectiveness at inhibiting fibrillogenesis. Studies on the interaction between Abeta and cell membranes led to the discovery that inositol, the head group of phosphatidylinositol, inhibits fibrillogenesis. As a result, scyllo-inositol is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of AD. Additional small-molecule inhibitors, including polyphenolic compounds such as curcumin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and grape seed extract have been shown to attenuate Abeta aggregation through distinct mechanisms, and have shown effectiveness at reducing amyloid levels when administered to transgenic mouse models of AD. Although the results of ongoing clinical trials remain to be seen, these compounds represent the first generation of amyloid-based therapeutics, with the potential to alter the progression of AD and, when used prophylactically, alleviate the deposition of Abeta.},

The large enhancement of its fluorescence emission upon binding to fibrils makes ThT a particularly powerful and convenient tool. Despite its widespread use in clinical and basic science applications, the molecular mechanism for the ability of ThT to recognize diverse types of amyloid fibrils and for the dye{\&}apos;s characteristic fluorescence has only begun to be elucidated. Here, we review recent progress in the understanding of ThT-fibril interactions at an atomic resolution. These studies have yielded important insights into amyloid structures and the processes of fibril formation, and they also offer guidance for designing the next generation of amyloid assembly diagnostics, inhibitors, and therapeutics.},

	Abstract = {Under solution conditions where the native state is destabilized, the largely helical polypeptide hormone insulin readily aggregates to form amyloid fibrils with a characteristic cross-beta structure. However, there is a lack of information relating the 4.8 A beta-strand repeat to the higher order assembly of amyloid fibrils. We have used cryo-electron microscopy (EM), combining single particle analysis and helical reconstruction, to characterize these fibrils and to study the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of their component protofilaments. Low-resolution 3D structures of fibrils containing 2, 4, and 6 protofilaments reveal a characteristic, compact shape of the insulin protofilament. Considerations of protofilament packing indicate that the cross-beta ribbon is composed of relatively flat beta-sheets rather than being the highly twisted, beta-coil structure previously suggested by analysis of globular protein folds. Comparison of the various fibril structures suggests that very small, local changes in beta-sheet twist are important in establishing the long-range coiling of the protofilaments into fibrils of diverse morphology.},

	Abstract = {Specific interactions between molecules, including those produced by a given solute, and the surrounding solvent are essential to drive molecular recognition processes. A simple molecule such as benzene is capable of recognizing and differentiating among very similar entities, such as methyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (alpha-Me(5)Gal), methyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (beta-Me(5)Gal), 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranose (beta-Ac(5)Gal), and methyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside (alpha-Me(5)Man). In order to determine if these complexes are formed, the interaction energy between benzene and the different carbohydrates was determined, using Calvet microcalorimetry, as the enthalpy of solvation. These enthalpy values were -89.0 +/- 2.0, -88.7 +/- 5.5, -132.5 +/- 6.2, and -78.8 +/- 3.9 kJ mol(-1) for the four complexes, respectively. Characterization of the different complexes was completed by establishing the molecular region where the interaction takes place using NMR. It was determined that beta-Me(5)Gal is stabilized by the CH/pi interaction produced by the nonpolar region of the carbohydrate on the alpha face. In contrast, alpha-Me(5)Man is not specifically solvated by benzene and does not present any stacking interaction. Although alpha-Me(5)Gal has a geometry similar to that of its epimer, the obtained NMR data seem to indicate that the axial methoxy group at the anomeric position increases the distance of the benzene molecules from the pyranose ring. Substitution of the methoxy groups by acetate moieties, as in beta-Ac(5)Gal, precludes the approach of benzene to produce the CH/pi interaction. In fact, the elevated stabilization energy of beta-Ac(5)Gal is probably due to the interaction between benzene and the methyl groups of the acetyls. Therefore, methoxy and acetyl substituents have different effects on the protons of the pyranose ring.},

	Abstract = {The conversion of soluble peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils and/or intermediate oligomers is believed to be the central event in the pathogenesis of most human neurodegenerative diseases. Existing treatments are at best symptomatic. Accordingly, small molecule inhibitors of amyloid fibril formation and their mechanisms are of great interest. Here we report that the conformational changes undergone by alpha -synuclein as it assembles into amyloid fibrils can be detected by epitope-specific antibodies. We show that the conformations of polyphenol-bound alpha-synuclein monomers and dimers differ from those of unbound monomers and resemble amyloid fibrils. This strongly suggests that small molecule inhibitors bind and stabilize intermediates of amyloid fibril formation, consistent with the view that inhibitor-bound molecular species are on-pathway intermediates.},

	Abstract = {Inositol is a simple polyol with eight naturally occurring stereoisomers. myo-Inositol, D-chiro- and epi-inositol have been examined as potential therapeutic agents for various diseases, with favorable results, but treatment with scyllo-inositol has not been previously investigated. Our laboratory has shown that scyllo-inositol inhibits cognitive deficits in TgCRND8 mice and significantly ameliorates disease pathology, suggesting it might be effective in treating Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease (AD). In this paper, we show that scyllo-inositol has a sustained ability to treat animals at advanced stages of AD-like pathology. Significant decreases in insoluble Abeta40, Abeta42, and plaque accumulation were observed in the brains of treated versus untreated TgCRND8 mice. The growth of plaques of all sizes was inhibited by scyllo-inositol administration. To demonstrate that the scyllo-inositol effects were within the CNS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to examine myo- and scyllo-inositol concentrations after oral administration. Further, we examined how closely scyllo- and myo-inositol are inter-regulated in the CNS and whether scyllo-inositol, if elevated within the CNS, would incorporate into phosphatidylinositol lipids. Cerebral spinal fluid levels of scyllo-inositol increased after scyllo-inositol treatment but not myo-inositol treatment. scyllo-Inositol treatment also caused increased levels of scyllo-inositol in the brain. We further show that scyllo-inositol, even at elevated levels, does not incorporate into the phosphatidylinositol family of lipids. These combined results demonstrate that scyllo-inositol accumulates within the CNS up to tenfold endogenous levels and does not interfere with phosphatidylinositol lipid production.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and amyloid formation are key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, and are considered to be two of the major contributing factors to neurodegeneration and dementia. Identification of small molecule inhibitors that are orally available, have low toxicity and high central nervous system bioavailability is one approach to the potential development of a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We have previously identified inositol stereoisomers as exhibiting stereospecific inhibition of Abeta aggregation and toxicity in vitro and in vivo. We report here the effects of inosose versus inositol stereoisomers on Abeta fibrillogenesis as determined using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy and negative-stain electron microscopy. The inososes differ from inositols by the oxidation of one of the hydroxyl groups to a ketone. These molecules help in the further elucidation of the structure-activity relationships of inositol-Abeta interactions and identify both allo-inositol and epi-2-inosose as in vitro inhibitors of Abeta aggregation.},

	Abstract = {The formation of well-ordered fibrillar protein deposits is common to a large group of amyloid-associated disorders. This group consists of several major human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion diseases, and type II diabetes. Currently, there is no approved therapeutic agent directed towards the formation of fibrillar assemblies, which have been recently shown to have a key role in the cytotoxic nature of amyloidogenic proteins. One important approach in the development of therapeutic agents is the use of small molecules that specifically and efficiently inhibit the aggregation process. Several small polyphenol molecules have been demonstrated to remarkably inhibit the formation of fibrillar assemblies in vitro and their associated cytotoxicity. Yet, the inhibition mechanism was mostly attributed to the antioxidative properties of these polyphenol compounds. Based on several observations demonstrating that polyphenols are capable of inhibiting amyloid fibril formation in vitro, regardless of oxidative conditions, and in view of their structural similarities we suggest an additional mechanism of action. This mechanism is assuming structural constraints and specific aromatic interactions, which direct polyphenol inhibitors to the amyloidogenic core. This proposed mechanism is highly relevant for future de novo inhibitors' design as therapeutic agents for the treatment of amyloid-associated diseases.},

@article{Nikolic:2011p185,
	Abstract = {The capacity to form β-sheet structure and to self-organize into amyloid aggregates is a property shared by many proteins. Severe neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease are thought to involve the interaction of amyloidogenic protein oligomers with neuronal membranes. To understand the experimentally observed catalysis of amyloid formation by lipid membranes and other water-hydrophobic interfaces, we examine the physico-chemical basis of peptide adsorption and aggregation in a model membrane using atomistic molecular simulations. Blocked octapeptides with simple, repetitive sequences, (Gly-Ala)₄, and (Gly-Val)₄, are used as models of β-sheet-forming polypeptide chains found in the core of amyloid fibrils. In the presence of an n-octane phase mimicking the core of lipid membranes, the peptides spontaneously partition at the octane-water interface. The adsorption of nonpolar sidechains displaces the peptides' conformational equilibrium from a heterogeneous ensemble characterized by a high degree of structural disorder toward a more ordered ensemble favoring β-hairpins and elongated β-strands. At the interface, peptides spontaneously aggregate and rapidly evolve β-sheet structure on a 10 to 100 ns time scale, while aqueous aggregates remain amorphous. Catalysis of β-sheet formation results from the combination of the hydrophobic effect and of reduced conformational entropy of the polypeptide chain. While the former drives interfacial partition and displaces the conformational equilibrium of monomeric peptides, the planar interface further facilitates β-sheet organization by increasing peptide concentration and reducing the dimensionality of self-assembly from three to two. These findings suggest a general mechanism for the formation of β-sheets on the surface of globular proteins and for amyloid self-organization at hydrophobic interfaces.},

@article{Biancalana:2009p211,
	Abstract = {A number of small organic molecules have been developed that bind to amyloid fibrils, a subset of which also inhibit fibrillization. Among these, the benzothiol dye Thioflavin-T (ThT) has been used for decades in the diagnosis of protein-misfolding diseases and in kinetic studies of self-assembly (fibrillization). Despite its importance, efforts to characterize the ThT-binding mechanism at the atomic level have been hampered by the inherent insolubility and heterogeneity of peptide self-assemblies. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a minimalist approach to designing a ThT-binding site in a {\&}quot;peptide self-assembly mimic{\&}quot; (PSAM) scaffold. PSAMs are engineered water-soluble proteins that mimic a segment of beta-rich peptide self-assembly, and they are amenable to standard biophysical techniques and systematic mutagenesis. The PSAM beta-sheet contains rows of repetitive amino acid patterns running perpendicular to the strands (cross-strand ladders) that represent a ubiquitous structural feature of fibril-like surfaces. We successfully designed a ThT-binding site that recapitulates the hallmarks of ThT-fibril interactions by constructing a cross-strand ladder consisting of contiguous tyrosines. The X-ray crystal structures suggest that ThT interacts with the beta-sheet by docking onto surfaces formed by a single tyrosine ladder, rather than in the space between adjacent ladders. Systematic mutagenesis further demonstrated that tyrosine surfaces across four or more beta-strands formed the minimal binding site for ThT. Our work thus provides structural insights into how this widely used dye recognizes a prominent subset of peptide self-assemblies, and proposes a strategy to elucidate the mechanisms of fibril-ligand interactions.},

	Abstract = {We describe solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on fibrils formed by the 40-residue beta-amyloid peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease (Abeta(1-40)) that place constraints on the identity and symmetry of contacts between in-register, parallel beta-sheets in the fibrils. We refer to these contacts as internal and external quaternary contacts, depending on whether they are within a single molecular layer or between molecular layers. The data include (1) two-dimensional 13C-13C NMR spectra that indicate internal quaternary contacts between side chains of L17 and F19 and side chains of I32, L34, and V36, as well as external quaternary contacts between side chains of I31 and G37; (2) two-dimensional 15N-13C NMR spectra that indicate external quaternary contacts between the side chain of M35 and the peptide backbone at G33; (3) measurements of magnetic dipole-dipole couplings between the side chain carboxylate group of D23 and the side chain amine group of K28 that indicate salt bridge interactions. Isotopic dilution experiments allow us to make distinctions between intramolecular and intermolecular contacts. On the basis of these data and previously determined structural constraints from solid-state NMR and electron microscopy, we construct full molecular models using restrained molecular dynamics simulations and restrained energy minimization. These models apply to Abeta(1-40) fibrils grown with gentle agitation. We also present evidence for different internal quaternary contacts in Abeta(1-40) fibrils grown without agitation, which are morphologically distinct.},

	Abstract = {Soluble amyloid oligomers are a cytotoxic species in Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease, and the recent discovery that trehalose can prohibit aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) has received great attention. However, its inhibition mechanism remains unclear. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibition effect, molecular dynamics simulations of Abeta(16-22) and Abeta(40) peptides at different trehalose concentrations (0-0.18 mol/L) are performed using an all-atom model. The simulations confirmed that Abeta(16-22) aggregation is prevented by trehalose in a dose-dependent manner, and it is found that the preferential exclusion effect of trehalose is the origin of its inhibition effects. Namely, there is preferential hydration on the peptide surface (3 A), and trehalose molecules cluster around the peptides at a distance of 4-5 A. At high trehalose concentrations, the preferential exclusion of trehalose leads to three sequential effects that prevent the nucleation and elongation of Abeta(16-22) oligomers. First, the secondary structures of Abeta(16-22) monomers are stabilized in the turn, bend, or coil, so the beta-sheet-rich structure that is prone to forming peptide oligomers is prevented. Second, the thin hydration layer and trehalose clusters can weaken hydrophobic interactions that lead to Abeta(16-22) aggregation. Third, more direct and indirect H-bonds form between trehalose and Abeta(16-22), which suppress the interpeptide hydrogen bonding. Analyses of the simulation data for a single Abeta(40) peptide indicate that trehalose can inhibit the nucleation and elongation of Abeta(40) by a similar mechanism with that on Abeta(16-22) oligomerization. The work has thus elucidated the molecular mechanism of trehalose on the inhibition of Abeta oligomeric aggregation.},

	Abstract = {scyllo-Inositol has shown promise as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease, by directly interacting with the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide to inhibit Abeta42 fiber formation. To explore the molecular details of the inositol-Abeta42 interaction, a series of scyllo-inositol derivatives have been synthesized which contain deoxy, fluoro, chloro, and methoxy substitutions. The effects of these compounds on the aggregation cascade of Abeta42 have been investigated using electron microscopy (EM). EM analyses revealed that the 1-deoxy-1-fluoro- and 1,4-dimethyl-scyllo-inositols significantly inhibit the formation of Abeta42 fibers. The other derivatives showed some alterations in the morphology of the Abeta42 fibers produced. These findings indicate the importance of all of the hydroxyl groups of scyllo-inositol for complete inhibition of Abeta aggregation.},

	Abstract = {We present a structural model for amyloid fibrils formed by the 40-residue beta-amyloid peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease (Abeta(1-40)), based on a set of experimental constraints from solid state NMR spectroscopy. The model additionally incorporates the cross-beta structural motif established by x-ray fiber diffraction and satisfies constraints on Abeta(1-40) fibril dimensions and mass-per-length determined from electron microscopy. Approximately the first 10 residues of Abeta(1-40) are structurally disordered in the fibrils. Residues 12-24 and 30-40 adopt beta-strand conformations and form parallel beta-sheets through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Residues 25-29 contain a bend of the peptide backbone that brings the two beta-sheets in contact through sidechain-sidechain interactions. A single cross-beta unit is then a double-layered beta-sheet structure with a hydrophobic core and one hydrophobic face. The only charged sidechains in the core are those of D23 and K28, which form salt bridges. Fibrils with minimum mass-per-length and diameter consist of two cross-beta units with their hydrophobic faces juxtaposed.},

@article{Esler:1996p288,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the presence of numerous insoluble amyloid plaques in the brain composed primarily of a 40-43 amino acid peptide, the human beta-amyloid peptide (A beta). The process of A beta deposition can be modeled in vitro by deposition of physiological concentrations of radiolabeled A beta onto preexisting amyloid in preparations of unfixed AD cerebral cortex. Using this model system, it has been shown that A beta deposition is biochemically distinct from A beta aggregation and occurs readily at physiological A beta concentrations, but which regions and conformations of A beta are essential to A beta deposition is poorly understood. We report here that an active congener, A beta (10-35)-NH2, displays time dependence, pH-activity profile, and kinetic order of deposition similar to A beta (1-40), and is sufficiently soluble for NMR spectroscopy in water under conditions where it actively deposits. To examine the importance of the central hydrophobic cluster of A beta (LVFFA, residues 17-21) for in vitro A beta deposition, an A beta (10-35)-NH2 analog with a single point substitution (F19T) in this region was synthesized and examined. Unlike A beta (10-35)-NH2, the F19T analog was plaque growth incompetent, and NMR analysis indicated that the mutant peptide was significantly less folded than wild-type A beta. These results support previous studies suggesting that the plaque competence of A beta correlates with peptide folding. Since compounds that alter A beta folding may reduce amyloid deposition, the central hydrophobic cluster of A beta will be a tempting target for structure-based drug design when high-resolution structural information becomes available.},

@article{Wang:2010p204,
	Abstract = {One of the key factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the conversion of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) from its soluble random coil form into various aggregated forms. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been proved effective in preventing the aggregation of Abeta, but the thermodynamic mechanisms are still unclear. In this work, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was utilized to study the interactions between Abeta42 and EGCG at different temperatures, salt concentrations, pH values, and EGCG and Abeta42 concentrations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the hydrogen bonding between Abeta42 and EGCG. The results indicate that the binding stoichiometry N is linearly related to the EGCG/Abeta42 ratio. Hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding are both substantial in the binding process, but the extent of their contributions changes with experimental conditions. Namely, the predominant interaction gradually shifts from a hydrogen bonding to a hydrophobic interaction with the increase of the EGCG/Abeta42 ratio, resulting in a transition of the binding from enthalpy-driven to entropy-driven. This experimental observation is validated by the MD simulations. The binding of EGCG to Abeta42 can be promoted by increasing temperature and salt concentration and changing pH away from Abeta42's pI. The findings have provided new insight into the molecular interactions between Abeta42 and EGCG from a thermodynamic perspective and are expected to facilitate the research on the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, small protein oligomers have been implicated in the aetiology of a number of important amyloid diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. As a consequence, research efforts are being directed away from traditional targets, such as amyloid plaques, and towards characterization of early oligomer states. Here we present a new analysis method, ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry, for this challenging problem, which allows determination of in vitro oligomer distributions and the qualitative structure of each of the aggregates. We applied these methods to a number of the amyloid-β protein isoforms of Aβ40 and Aβ42 and showed that their oligomer-size distributions are very different. Our results are consistent with previous observations that Aβ40 and Aβ42 self-assemble via different pathways and provide a candidate in the Aβ42 dodecamer for the primary toxic species in Alzheimer's disease.},

@article{Kony:2002p383,
	Abstract = {This work describes an improved version of the original OPLS-all atom (OPLS-AA) force field for carbohydrates (Damm et al., J Comp Chem 1997, 18, 1955). The improvement is achieved by applying additional scaling factors for the electrostatic interactions between 1,5- and 1,6-interactions. This new model is tested first for improving the conformational energetics of 1,2-ethanediol, the smallest polyol. With a 1,5-scaling factor of 1.25 the force field calculated relative energies are in excellent agreement with the ab initio-derived data. Applying the new 1,5-scaling makes it also necessary to use a 1,6-scaling factor for the interactions between the C4 and C6 atoms in hexopyranoses. After torsional parameter fitting, this improves the conformational energetics in comparison to the OPLS-AA force field. The set of hexopyranoses included in the torsional parameter derivation consists of the two anomers of D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-galactose, as well as of the methyl-pyranosides of D-glucose, D-mannose. Rotational profiles for the rotation of the exocyclic group and of different hydroxyl groups are also compared for the two force fields and at the ab initio level of theory. The new force field reduces the overly high barriers calculated using the OPLS-AA force field. This leads to better sampling, which was shown to produce more realistic conformational behavior for hexopyranoses in liquid simulation. From 10-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of alpha-D-glucose and alpha-D-galactose the ratios for the three different conformations of the hydroxymethylene group and the average (3)J(H,H) coupling constants are derived and compared to experimental values. The results obtained for OPLS-AA-SEI force field are in good agreement with experiment whereas the properties derived for the OPLS-AA force field suffer from sampling problems. The undertaken investigations show that the newly derived OPLS-AA-SEI force field will allow simulating larger carbohydrates or polysaccharides with improved sampling of the hydroxyl groups.},

	Abstract = {The accumulation of beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils or aggregates is a complex, multistep process that is associated with cellular toxicity in a number of human protein misfolding disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. It involves the formation of various transient and intransient, on- and off-pathway aggregate species, whose structure, size and cellular toxicity are largely unclear. Here we demonstrate redirection of amyloid fibril formation through the action of a small molecule, resulting in off-pathway, highly stable oligomers. The polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate efficiently inhibits the fibrillogenesis of both alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta by directly binding to the natively unfolded polypeptides and preventing their conversion into toxic, on-pathway aggregation intermediates. Instead of beta-sheet-rich amyloid, the formation of unstructured, nontoxic alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta oligomers of a new type is promoted, suggesting a generic effect on aggregation pathways in neurodegenerative diseases.},

@article{Wood:1995p190,
	Abstract = {Although it is well accepted that the structure of amyloid fibrils is dominated by some form of antiparallel beta-sheet, there are few details on the secondary structural arrangements of the constituent peptides and how these peptides pack together in the fibril. We describe here the use of scanning proline mutagenesis to map the secondary structural roles of each residue in amyloidogenic peptide fragments of the Alzheimer{\&}apos;s amyloid peptide beta/A4. In two series of fragments related to residues 15-23 and 12-26 of beta/A4, we show that Pro replacement of any residue in the amyloidogenic sequence LVFFAED, corresponding to residues 17-23, leads to essentially complete loss of fibril formation and to excellent peptide solubility. Since peptidyl-prolyl bonds are incapable of forming standard extended chain conformations, the results suggest that residues 17-23 make up the beta-sheet core of the fibrils formed by these fragments. In contrast to the proline replacements, alanine substitutions at residues 17, 18, and 20 have no effect on fibril formation, while replacement of Phe19 reduces fibril formation to 15% of the level found for the wild type sequence. Scanning proline mutagenesis should play a useful role in mapping the secondary structural features of larger amyloidogenic peptide sequences, including longer, physiologically relevant forms of beta/A4. In addition, these results suggest explanations for some amyloidogenic effects observed in disease-related peptides and also suggest a possible role for aggregation-inhibiting insertion of prolines in protein evolution and protein design.},

@article{McLaurin:1998p176,
	Abstract = {A key pathological feature of Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease is the formation and accumulation of amyloid fibres. The major component is the 39 to 42 residue amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) which is an internal proteolytic fragment of the integral membrane amyloid precursor protein. Aggregation of Abeta into insoluble amyloid fibres is a nucleation-dependent event that may be modulated by the presence of amyloid-associated molecules. Fibril formation is also associated with neurotoxicity which may be the result of specific Abeta interactions with membrane proteins and/or lipids. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, tyrosine fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy, we have examined the binding of Abeta peptides 1-40 (Abeta40) and 1-42 (Abeta42) to the glycolipid, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and different inositol headgroups. At pH 6.0 and in the presence of PI vesicles, both Abeta40 and Abeta42 adopted an amyloidogenic beta-structure. In contrast, at neutral pH only Abeta42 folded into a beta-structure in the presence of PI vesicles. To determine whether the induction of beta-structure stemmed from interactions with the headgroup of PI, the effects of inositol derivatives on Abeta were also examined. At pH 7.0, myo-inositol was sufficient to induce beta-structure in Abeta42 but had no effect on the conformation of Abeta40. Myo-inositol may promote beta-structure as a result of its ability to be both a hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor. Mono-, di- and triphosphorylated forms of inositol had reduced ability to induce beta-structure in both peptides. The results from this study indicate that interaction of Abeta40 and Abeta42 with PI acts as a seed for fibril formation while myo-inositol stabilizes a soluble Abeta42 micelle.},

@article{Soto:2007p171,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder associated with the abnormal self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into fibrillar species. N-methylated peptides homologous to the central hydrophobic core of the Abeta peptide are potent inhibitors of this aggregation process. In this work, we use fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of the N-methylated peptide inhibitor Abeta16-20m (Ac-Lys(16)-(Me)Leu(17)-Val(18)-(Me)Phe(19)-Phe(20)-NH(2)) with a model protofilament consisting of Alzheimer Abeta16-22 peptides. Our simulations indicate that the inhibitor peptide can bind to the protofilament at four different sites: 1), at the edge of the protofilament; 2), on the exposed face of a protofilament layer; 3), between the protofilament layers; and 4), between the protofilament strands. The different binding scenarios suggest several mechanisms of fibrillogenesis inhibition: 1), fibril inhibition of longitudinal growth (in the direction of monomer deposition); 2), fibril inhibition of lateral growth (in the direction of protofilament assembly); and 3), fibril disassembly by strand removal and perturbation of the periodicity of the protofilament (disruption of fibril morphology). Our simulations suggest that the Abeta16-20m inhibitor can act on both prefibrillar species and mature fibers and that the specific mechanism of inhibition may depend on the structural nature of the Abeta aggregate. Disassembly of the fibril can be explained by a mechanism through which the inhibitor peptides bind to disaggregated or otherwise free Abeta16-22 peptides in solution, leading to a shift in the equilibrium from a fibrillar state to one dominated by inhibitor-bound Abeta16-22 peptides.},

Mentions that the "the convergence of simuations was confrimed by many reversible binding events of dye molecules to beta sheet" (page 4, first paragraph)

There is the one figure in the supplementary materials that shows a fluctuating contacts ... and they state without saying how they got it - that there is 20 contact events per trajectory?
    - probably wasn't an important point ..

Also there are parameters along with the supporting materials (for amber)

This paper is interesting - NOTE - read it to see how they deal with explaining the aromatic interactions and how MD forcefields handle that....
