	Abstract = {Although extensive data support a central pathogenic role for amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid hypothesis remains controversial, in part because a specific neurotoxic species of Abeta and the nature of its effects on synaptic function have not been defined in vivo. Here we report that natural oligomers of human Abeta are formed soon after generation of the peptide within specific intracellular vesicles and are subsequently secreted from the cell. Cerebral microinjection of cell medium containing these oligomers and abundant Abeta monomers but no amyloid fibrils markedly inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats in vivo. Immunodepletion from the medium of all Abeta species completely abrogated this effect. Pretreatment of the medium with insulin-degrading enzyme, which degrades Abeta monomers but not oligomers, did not prevent the inhibition of LTP. Therefore, Abeta oligomers, in the absence of monomers and amyloid fibrils, disrupted synaptic plasticity in vivo at concentrations found in human brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, treatment of cells with gamma-secretase inhibitors prevented oligomer formation at doses that allowed appreciable monomer production, and such medium no longer disrupted LTP, indicating that synaptotoxic Abeta oligomers can be targeted therapeutically.},

@article{Chromy:2003p2575,
	Abstract = {Amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)) is a self-associating peptide that becomes neurotoxic upon aggregation. Toxicity originally was attributed to the presence of large, readily formed Abeta fibrils, but a variety of other toxic species are now known. The current study shows that Abeta(1-42) can self-assemble into small, stable globular assemblies free of fibrils and protofibrils. Absence of large molecules was verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Denaturing electrophoresis revealed that the globular assemblies comprised oligomers ranging from trimers to 24mers. Oligomers prepared at 4 degrees C stayed fibril-free for days and remained so when shifted to 37 degrees C, although the spectrum of sizes shifted toward larger oligomers at the higher temperature. The soluble, globular Abeta(1-42) oligomers were toxic to PC12 cells, impairing reduction of MTT and interfering with ERK and Rac signal transduction. Occasionally, oligomers were neither toxic nor recognized by toxicity-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that oligomers could assume alternative conformations. Tests for oligomerization-blocking activity were carried out by dot-blot immunoassays and showed that neuroprotective extracts of Ginkgo biloba could inhibit oligomer formation at very low doses. The observed neurotoxicity, structure, and stability of synthetic Abeta(1-42) globular assemblies support the hypothesis that Abeta(1-42) oligomers play a role in triggering nerve cell dysfunction and death in Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {Fibrillogenesis of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a seminal pathogenetic event in Alzheimer's disease. Inhibiting fibrillogenesis is thus one approach toward disease therapy. Rational design of fibrillogenesis inhibitors requires elucidation of the stages and kinetics of Abeta fibrillogenesis. We report results of studies designed to examine the initial stages of Abeta oligomerization. Size exclusion chromatography, quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy, and electron microscopy were used to characterize fibrillogenesis intermediates. After dissolution in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and removal of pre-existent seeds, Abeta chromatographed almost exclusively as a single peak. The molecules composing the peak had average hydrodynamic radii of 1.8 +/- 0.2 nm, consistent with the predicted size of dimeric Abeta. Over time, an additional peak, with a molecular weight >100,000, appeared. This peak contained predominantly curved fibrils, 6-8 nm in diameter and <200 nm in length, which we have termed "protofibrils." The kinetics of protofibril formation and disappearance are consistent with protofibrils being intermediates in the evolution of amyloid fibers. Protofibrils appeared during the polymerization of Abeta-(1-40), Abeta-(1-42), and Abeta-(1-40)-Gln22, peptides associated with both sporadic and inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that protofibril formation may be a general phenomenon in Abeta fibrillogenesis. If so, protofibrils could be attractive targets for fibrillogenesis inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {Studies by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of amyloid fibrils prepared in vitro from synthetic 40-residue beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-40)) peptides have shown that the molecular structure of Abeta(1-40) fibrils is not uniquely determined by amino acid sequence. Instead, the fibril structure depends on the precise details of growth conditions. The molecular structures of beta-amyloid fibrils that develop in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are therefore uncertain. We demonstrate through thioflavin T fluorescence and electron microscopy that fibrils extracted from brain tissue of deceased AD patients can be used to seed the growth of synthetic Abeta(1-40) fibrils, allowing preparation of fibrils with isotopic labeling and in sufficient quantities for solid-state NMR and other measurements. Because amyloid structures propagate themselves in seeded growth, as shown in previous studies, the molecular structures of brain-seeded synthetic Abeta(1-40) fibrils most likely reflect structures that are present in AD brain. Solid-state (13)C NMR spectra of fibril samples seeded with brain material from two AD patients were found to be nearly identical, indicating the same molecular structures. Spectra of an unseeded control sample indicate greater structural heterogeneity. (13)C chemical shifts and other NMR data indicate that the predominant molecular structure in brain-seeded fibrils differs from the structures of purely synthetic Abeta(1-40) fibrils that have been characterized in detail previously. These results demonstrate a new approach to detailed structural characterization of amyloid fibrils that develop in human tissue, and to investigations of possible correlations between fibril structure and the degree of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in AD.},

	Abstract = {The growth of amyloid fibrils is studied by replica exchange molecular dynamics in an implicit solvent. Our data indicate that extremely long simulation times (at least a few hundred ns) are necessary to study the thermodynamics of fibril elongation in detail. However some aspects of the aggregation process are already accessible on the time scales available in the present study. A peak in the specific heat indicates a docking temperature of T(dock) ≈ 320 K. Irreversible locking requires lower temperatures with the locking temperature estimated as T(lock) ≈ 280 K. In our simulation the fibril grows from both sides with the C-terminal of the incoming monomer attaching to the C-terminal of the peptides in the fibril forming a β-sheet on the fibril edge. Our simulation indicates that the C-terminal is crucial for aggregation.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative understanding of the kinetics of fibril formation and the molecular mechanism of transition from monomers to fibrils is needed to obtain insights into the growth of amyloid fibrils and more generally self-assembly multisubunit protein complexes. Significant advances using computations of protein aggregation in a number of systems have established generic and sequence-specific aspects of the early steps in oligomer formation. Theoretical considerations, which view oligomer and fibril growth as diffusion in a complex energy landscape, and computational studies, involving minimal lattice and coarse-grained models, have revealed general principles governing the transition from monomeric protein to ordered fibrillar aggregates. Detailed atomistic calculations have explored the early stages of the protein aggregation pathway for a number of amyloidogenic proteins, most notably amyloid β- (Aβ-) protein and fragments from proteins linked to various diseases. These computational studies have provided insights into the role of sequence, role of water, and specific interatomic interactions underlying the thermodynamics and dynamics of elementary kinetic steps in the aggregation pathway. Novel methods are beginning to illustrate the structural basis for the production of Aβ-peptides through interactions with secretases in the presence of membranes. We show that a variety of theoretical approaches, ranging from scaling arguments to minimal models to atomistic simulations, are needed as a complement to experimental studies probing the principles governing protein aggregation. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Physical Chemistry Volume 62 is March 31, 2011. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.},

	Abstract = {A critical aspect to understanding the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the characterization of the kinetics of interconversion between the different species present during amyloid-β protein (Aβ) aggregation. By monitoring hydrogen/deuterium exchange in Aβ fibrils using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the Aβ molecules comprising the fibril continuously dissociate and reassociate, resulting in molecular recycling within the fibril population. Investigations on Aβ40 and Aβ42 amyloid fibrils reveal that molecules making up Aβ40 fibrils recycle to a much greater extent than those of Aβ42. By examining factors that could influence molecular recycling and by running simulations, we show that the rate constant for dissociation of molecules from the fibril (k(off)) is much greater for Aβ40 than that for Aβ42. Importantly, the k(off) values obtained for Aβ40 and Aβ42 reveal that recycling occurs on biologically relevant time scales. These results have implications for understanding the role of Aβ fibrils in neurotoxicity and for designing therapeutic strategies against AD.},

However, a therapeutic trial of immunization with Abeta42 in humans was discontinued because a few patients developed significant meningo-encephalitic cellular inflammatory reactions. Here we show that beneficial effects in mice arise from antibodies selectively directed against residues 4-10 of Abeta42, and that these antibodies inhibit both Abeta fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity without eliciting an inflammatory response. These findings provide the basis for improved immunization antigens as well as attempts to design small-molecule mimics as alternative therapies.},

	Abstract = {Converging lines of evidence suggest that progressive accumulation of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) plays a central role in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease, but it was long assumed that A beta had to be assembled into extracellular amyloid fibrils to exert its cytotoxic effects. Over the past decade, data have emerged from the use of synthetic A beta peptides, cell culture models, beta-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice and human brain to suggest that pre-fibrillar, diffusible assemblies of A beta are also deleterious. Although the precise molecular identity of these soluble toxins remains unsettled, accumulating evidence suggests that soluble forms of A beta are indeed the proximate effectors of synapse loss and neuronal injury. Here we review recent progress in understanding the role of soluble oligomers in Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {The effect of single amino acid substitutions associated with the Italian (E22K), Arctic (E22G), Dutch (E22Q) and Iowa (D23N) familial forms of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy on the structure of the 21-30 fragment of the Alzheimer amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is investigated by replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The 21-30 segment has been shown in our earlier work to adopt a bend structure in solution that may serve as the folding nucleation site for Abeta. Our simulations reveal that the 24-28 bend motif is retained in all E22 mutants, suggesting that mutations involving residue E22 may not affect the structure of the folding nucleation site of Abeta. Enhanced aggregation in Abeta with familial Alzheimer's disease substitutions may result from the depletion of the E22-K28 salt bridge, which destabilizes the bend structure. Alternately, the E22 mutations may affect longer-range interactions outside the 21-30 segment that can impact the aggregation of Abeta. Substituting at residue D23, on the other hand, leads to the formation of a turn rather than a bend motif, implying that in contrast to E22 mutants, the D23N mutant may affect monomer Abeta folding and subsequent aggregation. Our simulations suggest that the mechanisms by which E22 and D23 mutations affect the folding and aggregation of Abeta are fundamentally different.},

@article{Marshall:2011p8722,
	Abstract = {The mechanism by which side chains mediate and modulate amyloid assembly is a pressing question that impacts on both disease related and functionally related amyloid. Amyloid fibrils are characterised by a cross-β structure in which hydrogen bonding is known to provide a means to elongate and polymerise the fibrillar structures. However, side chains impact on the propensity to aggregate and provide a framework by which different morphologies can be formed and the structures can be stabilised via both intersheet and interstrand specific interactions. Amyloid-like fibrous crystals formed by the peptide KFFEAAAKKFFE have been previously characterised and provide an ideal model system to examine the importance of specific interactions by introducing specific substitutions. We find that the removal of any phenylalanine residue completely abrogates assembly ability, whilst charged residues modulate interactions within the structure resulting in alternative fibrillar morphologies. X-ray fibre diffraction analysis reveals that the essential backbone packing of the peptide molecules is maintained, whilst small changes accommodate differences in side chain size in the variants. We conclude that even very short peptides are adaptable and add to the growing knowledge regarding amyloid polymorphisms. Additionally, this work impacts on our understanding of the importance of residue composition for amyloidogenic peptides, in particular the roles of electrostatic, aromatic and hydrophobic interactions in amyloid assembly.},

	Abstract = {Deposition of amyloid fibrils, consisting primarily of Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) peptides, in the extracellular space in the brain is a major characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently developed new (to our knowledge) drug candidates for AD that inhibit the fibril formation of Aβ peptides and eliminate their neurotoxicity. We performed all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations on the Aβ(42) monomer at its α-helical conformation and a pentamer fibril fragment of Aβ(42) peptide with or without LRL and fluorene series compounds to investigate the mechanism of inhibition. The results show that the active drug candidates, LRL22 (EC(50) = 0.734 μM) and K162 (EC(50) = 0.080 μM), stabilize hydrophobic core I of Aβ(42) peptide (residues 17-21) to its α-helical conformation by interacting specifically in this region. The nonactive drug candidates, LRL27 (EC(50) > 10 μM) and K182 (EC(50) > 5 μM), have little to no similar effect. This explains the different behavior of the drug candidates in experiments. Of more importance, this phenomenon indicates that hydrophobic core I of the Aβ(42) peptide plays a major mechanistic role in the formation of amyloid fibrils, and paves the way for the development of new drugs against AD.},

	Abstract = {Characterization of the polymorphic structural range of A-beta oligomers is important to the understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity. Yet, for highly polymorphic ensembles, experimental structural elucidation is difficult. Here we use a combination of NMR solvent protection experiments and computational structural screening to identify major species in the amyloid conformational ensemble. We examined the polymorphic pentamer and fibril seeds of A-beta42 and its mutants and compared the theoretical backbone amide protection obtained from simulations with experimental hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange protection ratio. We observed that highly flexible pentamers do not share structural similarities with fibril seed oligomers, except the turn regions. We found that a novel amyloid structural motif of a triple-beta-sheet, with the N-terminal residues interacting with the core (K17-E22) beta-sheet region correlates with H/D exchange protection. The triple-beta-sheet A-beta42 oligomer has a minimal exposure of hydrophobic residues and is further stabilized by the E22Q (Dutch) mutation in Alzheimers disease. The experimental H/D exchange solvent protection ratio implies that triple-beta-sheets fibrils and globulomers could co-exist in the A-beta42 ensemble, pointing to a broad heterogeneous aggregate population. Our results suggest that an approach that combines computational modeling with NMR protection data can be a useful strategy for obtaining clues to the preferred conformational species of the assemblies in solution, and help in alleviating experimental difficulties and consequently possible errors in the exchange data for A-beta42 fibrils.},

	Abstract = {The misfolding and aggregation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) into amyloid fibrils, a process that has been pathologically linked to the onset of Alzheimer's disease, is dependent on the presence of a heterogeneous surface (e.g., cell membrane). Understanding of the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation and associated structural transition from monomers to intermediates and eventually to fibrils is critical for the development of viable therapeutic agents. In this work, using circular dichroism (CD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we studied the adsorption, aggregation, and conformational changes of Aβ(1-42) from fresh monomers to fully grown fibrils on four model self-assembled monolayers (SAMs): hydrophobic CH(3)-terminated SAM, hydrophilic OH-terminated SAM, negatively charged COOH-terminated SAMs, and positively charged NH(2)-terminated SAM. The seeding effect of Aβ(1-42) on the kinetics of Aβ aggregation on different SAMs is also examined. The CD, AFM, and SPR data show that all of these SAMs greatly accelerate the formation of β-sheets and amyloid fibrils through surface-enhanced interactions, but Aβ(1-42) peptides preferentially adsorb on a hydrophobic CH(3)-SAM and a positively charged NH(2)-SAM with much stronger interactions than on a hydrophilic OH-SAM and a negatively charged COOH-SAM. MD simulations further reveal that hydrophobic interactions present a general driving force for Aβ adsorption on all SAMs. As Aβ aggregates grow into larger species by packing hydrophobic C-terminals to form a hydrophobic core while exposing hydrophilic and negatively charged N-terminals to solution, electrostatic interactions become more strengthened when they interact with the SAMs especially for the COOH-SAM and the NH(2)-SAM. Thus, both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions contribute differently to different Aβ-SAM systems and to different aggregation stages. A postulated mechanism is proposed to describe the structure and kinetics of Aβ aggregation from aqueous solution to the SAMs, providing valuable insights into Aβ aggregation on biological cell membranes.},

@article{Jang:2011cr,
	Abstract = {Protegrin-1 (PG-1) is an 18 residues long, cysteine-rich β-sheet antimicrobial peptide (AMP). PG-1 induces strong cytotoxic activities on cell membrane and acts as a potent antibiotic agent. Earlier we reported that its cytotoxicity is mediated by its channel-forming ability. In this study, we have examined the amyloidogenic fibril formation properties of PG-1 in comparison with a well-defined amyloid, the amyloid-β (Aβ(1-42)) peptide. We have used atomic force microscopy (AFM) and thioflavin-T staining to investigate the kinetics of PG-1 fibrils growth and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the underlying mechanism. AFM images of PG-1 on a highly hydrophilic surface (mica) show fibrils with morphological similarities to Aβ(1-42) fibrils. Real-time AFM imaging of fibril growth suggests that PG-1 fibril growth follows a relatively fast kinetics compared to the Aβ(1-42) fibrils. The AFM results are in close agreement with results from thioflavin-T staining data. Furthermore, the results indicate that PG-1 forms fibrils in solution. Significantly, in contrast, we do not detect fibrillar structures of PG-1 on an anionic lipid bilayer 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; only small PG-1 oligomers can be observed. Molecular dynamics simulations are able to identify the presence of these small oligomers on the membrane bilayer. Thus, our current results show that cytotoxic AMP PG-1 is amyloidogenic and capable of forming fibrils. Overall, comparing β-rich AMPs and amyloids such as Aβ, in addition to cytotoxicity and amyloidogenicity, they share a common structural motif, and are channel forming. These combined properties support a functional relationship between amyloidogenic peptides and β-sheet-rich cytolytic AMPs, suggesting that amyloids channels may have an antimicrobial function.},

@article{Wang:2011wn,
	Abstract = {Aβ is widely recognized as a key molecule in Alzheimer's disease, causing neurotoxicity through Aβ aggregates such as Aβ oligomers and fibrils. Aβ40 and Aβ42, composed of 40 and 42 residues, respectively, are the major Aβ species in human brain. Aβ42 aggregates much faster than Aβ40 but the mechanism of such difference in aggregation propensity is poorly understood. Using NMR spin relaxation, we have shown that Aβ40 and Aβ42 monomers have different dynamics in both backbone and sidechain on the ps-ns time scale. Aβ42 is more rigid in C-terminus in both backbone and sidechain while Aβ40 has more rigid methyl groups in the central hydrophobic cluster (CHC: Aβ17-21). These observations are consistent with differences in the major conformations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 monomers derived from replica exchange MD (REMD). To further demonstrate the relevance of dynamics in aggregation mechanism, a perturbation was introduced to Aβ42 in the form of M35 oxidation. After M35 side chain oxidation to sulfoxide, Aβ42 experiences Aβ40-like changes in dynamics. At the same time, M35 oxidation causes dramatic reduction in Aβ42 aggregation rate. These data have thus established an important role for protein dynamics in the mechanism of Aβ aggregation.},

@article{Viet:2011dl,
	Abstract = {The effects of beta-sheet breaker peptides KLVFF and LPFFD on the oligomerization of amyloid peptides were studied by all-atom simulations. It was found that LPFFD interferes the aggregation of Aβ(16-22) peptides to a greater extent than does KLVFF. Using the molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method, we found that the former binds more strongly to Aβ(16-22). Therefore, by simulations, we have clarified the relationship between aggregation rates and binding affinity: the stronger the ligand binding, the slower the oligomerization process. The binding affinity of pentapeptides to full-length peptide Aβ(1-40) and its mature fibrils has been considered using the Autodock and MM-PBSA methods. The hydrophobic interaction between ligands and receptors plays a more important role for association than does hydrogen bonding. The influence of beta-sheet breaker peptides on the secondary structures of monomer Aβ(1-40) was studied in detail, and it turns out that, in their presence, the total beta-sheet content can be enhanced. However, the aggregation can be slowed because the beta-content is reduced in fibril-prone regions. Both pentapeptides strongly bind to monomer Aβ(1-40), as well as to mature fibrils, but KLVFF displays a lower binding affinity than LPFFD. Our findings are in accord with earlier experiments that both of these peptides can serve as prominent inhibitors. In addition, we predict that LPFFD inhibits/degrades the fibrillogenesis of full-length amyloid peptides better than KLVFF. This is probably related to a difference in their total hydrophobicities in that the higher the hydrophobicity, the lower the inhibitory capacity. The GROMOS96 43a1 force field with explicit water and the force field proposed by Morris et al. (Morris et al. J. Comput. Chem. 1998, 19, 1639 ) were employed for all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and Autodock experiments, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid-β protein (Aβ) is the principal component of the neuritic plaques found in Alzheimer's disease. The predominant Aβ morphology in the plaques is fibrillar which has prompted substantial in vitro work to better understand the molecular organization of Aβ fibrils. In the current study, tryptophan substitutions were made at Aβ(1-40) position 19 (F19W) or 20 (F20W) to ascertain environmental differences between the two residues in the fibril structure. Kinetic studies revealed similar rates of fibril formation between Aβ(1-40) F19W and F20W and both peptides formed typical amyloid fibril structures. Aβ(1-40) F19W fibrils displayed a significant tryptophan fluorescence blue-shift in λ(max) (33nm) compared to monomer while Aβ(1-40) F20W fibrils had a much smaller shift (9nm). Fluorescence quenching experiments with water-soluble acrylamide and KI demonstrated that both W19 and W20 were much less accessible to quenching in fibrils compared to monomer. Lipid-soluble TEMPO quenched the fluorescence of Aβ(1-40) F19W fibrils more effectively than F20W fibrils in agreement with the fluorescence blue-shift results. These findings demonstrate distinct environments between Aβ(1-40) residues 19 and 20 fibrils and indicate that while W20 accessibility is compromised in Aβ fibrils it resides in a much less hydrophobic environment than W19.},

@article{Thirumalai:2011cc,
	Abstract = {A variety of neurodegenerative diseases are associated with amyloid plaques, which begin as soluble protein oligomers but develop into amyloid fibrils. Our incomplete understanding of this process underscores the need to decipher the principles governing protein aggregation. Mechanisms of in vivo amyloid formation involve a number of coconspirators and complex interactions with membranes. Nevertheless, understanding the biophysical basis of simpler in vitro amyloid formation is considered important for discovering ligands that preferentially bind regions harboring amyloidogenic tendencies. The determination of the fibril structure of many peptides has set the stage for probing the dynamics of oligomer formation and amyloid growth through computer simulations. Most experimental and simulation studies, however, have been interpreted largely from the perspective of proteins: the role of solvent has been relatively overlooked in oligomer formation and assembly to protofilaments and amyloid fibrils. In this Account, we provide a perspective on how interactions with water affect folding landscapes of amyloid beta (Aβ) monomers, oligomer formation in the Aβ16-22 fragment, and protofilament formation in a peptide from yeast prion Sup35. Explicit molecular dynamics simulations illustrate how water controls the self-assembly of higher order structures, providing a structural basis for understanding the kinetics of oligomer and fibril growth. Simulations show that monomers of Aβ peptides sample a number of compact conformations. The formation of aggregation-prone structures (N*) with a salt bridge, strikingly similar to the structure in the fibril, requires overcoming a high desolvation barrier. In general, sequences for which N* structures are not significantly populated are unlikely to aggregate. Oligomers and fibrils generally form in two steps. First, water is expelled from the region between peptides rich in hydrophobic residues (for example, Aβ16-22), resulting in disordered oligomers. Then the peptides align along a preferred axis to form ordered structures with anti-parallel β-strand arrangement. The rate-limiting step in the ordered assembly is the rearrangement of the peptides within a confining volume. The mechanism of protofilament formation in a polar peptide fragment from the yeast prion, in which the two sheets are packed against each other and create a dry interface, illustrates that water dramatically slows self-assembly. As the sheets approach each other, two perfectly ordered one-dimensional water wires form. They are stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the amide groups of the polar side chains, resulting in the formation of long-lived metastable structures. Release of trapped water from the pore creates a helically twisted protofilament with a dry interface. Similarly, the driving force for addition of a solvated monomer to a preformed fibril is water release; the entropy gain and favorable interpeptide hydrogen bond formation compensate for entropy loss in the peptides. We conclude by offering evidence that a two-step model, similar to that postulated for protein crystallization, must also hold for higher order amyloid structure formation starting from N*. Distinct water-laden polymorphic structures result from multiple N* structures. Water plays multifarious roles in all of these protein aggregations. In predominantly hydrophobic sequences, water accelerates fibril formation. In contrast, water-stabilized metastable intermediates dramatically slow fibril growth rates in hydrophilic sequences.},

@article{Satheeshkumar:2003da,
	Abstract = {Conformational transitions are thought to be the prime mechanism of amyloid formation in prion diseases. The prion proteins are known to exhibit polymorphic behavior that explains their ability of "conformation switching" facilitated by structured "seeds" consisting of transformed proteins. Oligopeptides containing prion sequences showing the polymorphism are not known even though amyloid formation is observed in these fragments. In this work, we have observed polymorphism in a 15-residue peptide PrP (113-127) that is known to form amyloid fibrils on aging. To see the polymorphic behavior of this peptide in different solvent environments, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic studies on an aqueous solution of PrP (113-127) in different trifluoroethanol (TFE) concentrations were carried out. The results show that PrP (113-127) have sheet preference in lower TFE concentration whereas it has more helical conformation in higher TFE content (>40%). The structural transitions involved in TFE solvent were studied using interval-scan CD and FT-IR studies. It is interesting to note that the alpha-helical structure persists throughout the structural transition process involved in amyloid fibril formation implicating the involvement of both N- and C-terminal sequences. To unravel the role of the N-terminal region in the polymorphism of the PrP (113-127), CD studies on another synthetic peptide, PrP (113-120) were carried out. PrP(113-120) exhibits random coil conformation in 100% water and helical conformation in 100% TFE, indicating the importance of full-length sequence for beta-sheet formation. Besides, the influence of different chemico-physical conditions such as concentration, pH, ionic strength, and membrane like environment on the secondary structure of the peptide PrP (113-127) has been investigated. At higher concentration, PrP (113-127) shows features of sheet conformation even in 100% TFE suggesting aggregation. In the presence of 5% solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate, PrP (113-127) takes high alpha-helical propensity. The environment-dependent conformational polymorphism of PrP (113-127) and its marked tendency to form stable beta-sheet structure at acidic pH could account for its conformation switching behavior from alpha-helix to beta-sheet. This work emphasizes the coordinative involvement of N-terminal and C-terminal sequences in the self-assembly of PrP (113-127).},

	Abstract = {A molecular basis for memory failure in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently hypothesized, in which a significant role is attributed to small, soluble oligomers of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta). A beta oligomeric ligands (also known as ADDLs) are known to be potent inhibitors of hippocampal long-term potentiation, which is a paradigm for synaptic plasticity, and have been linked to synapse loss and reversible memory failure in transgenic mouse AD models. If such oligomers were to build up in human brain, their neurological impact could provide the missing link that accounts for the poor correlation between AD dementia and amyloid plaques. This article, using antibodies raised against synthetic A beta oligomers, verifies the predicted accumulation of soluble oligomers in AD frontal cortex. Oligomers in AD reach levels up to 70-fold over control brains. Brain-derived and synthetic oligomers show structural equivalence with respect to mass, isoelectric point, and recognition by conformation-sensitive antibodies. Both oligomers, moreover, exhibit the same striking patterns of attachment to cultured hippocampal neurons, binding on dendrite surfaces in small clusters with ligand-like specificity. Binding assays using solubilized membranes show oligomers to be high-affinity ligands for a small number of nonabundant proteins. Current results confirm the prediction that soluble oligomeric A beta ligands are intrinsic to AD pathology, and validate their use in new approaches to therapeutic AD drugs and vaccines.},

@article{Ito:2011gi,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is associated with formation of amyloid fibrils caused by polymerization of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), which is a process that requires unfolding of the native helical structure of Aβ. According to recent experimental studies, stabilization of the Aβ central helix is effective in preventing Aβ polymerization into toxic assemblies. To uncover the fundamental mechanism of unfolding of the Aβ central helix, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for wild-type (WT), V18A/F19A/F20A mutant (MA), and V18L/F19L/F20L mutant (ML) models of the Aβ central helix. It was quantitatively demonstrated that the stability of the α-helical conformation of both MA and ML is higher than that of WT, indicating that the α-helical propensity of the three nonpolar residues (18, 19, and 20) is the main factor for the stability of the whole Aβ central helix and that their hydrophobicity plays a secondary role. WT was found to completely unfold by a three-step mechanism: 1) loss of α-helical backbone hydrogen bonds, 2) strong interactions between nonpolar sidechains, and 3) strong interactions between polar sidechains. WT did not completely unfold in cases when any of the three steps was omitted. MA and ML did not completely unfold mainly due to the lack of the first step. This suggests that disturbances in any of the three steps would be effective in inhibiting the unfolding of the Aβ central helix. Our findings would pave the way for design of new drugs to prevent or retard AD.},

@article{Mitternacht:2011br,
	Abstract = {Small soluble oligomers, and dimers in particular, of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) are believed to play an important pathological role in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigate the spontaneous dimerization of Aβ42, with 42 residues, by implicit solvent all-atom Monte Carlo simulations, for the wild-type peptide and the mutants F20E, E22G and E22G/I31E. The observed dimers of these variants share many overall conformational characteristics but differ in several aspects at a detailed level. In all four cases, the most common type of secondary structure is intramolecular antiparallel β-sheets. Parallel, in-register β-sheet structure, as in models for Aβ fibrils, is rare. The primary force driving the formation of dimers is hydrophobic attraction. The conformational differences that we do see involve turns centered in the 20-30 region. The probability of finding turns centered in the 25-30 region, where there is a loop in Aβ fibrils, is found to increase upon dimerization and to correlate with experimentally measured rates of fibril formation for the different Aβ42 variants. Our findings hint at reorganization of this part of the molecule as a potentially critical step in Aβ aggregation.},

@article{Sgourakis:2007p285,
	Abstract = {The role of peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is frequently emphasized in the literature. It is known that Abeta42 is more prone to aggregation than Abeta40, even though they differ in only two (IA) amino acid residues at the C-terminal end. A direct comparison of the ensembles of conformations adopted by the monomers in solution has been limited by the inherent flexibility of the unfolded peptides. Here, we characterize the conformations of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in water by using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and measured scalar (3)J(HNHalpha) data from NMR experiments. We perform replica exchange MD (REMD) simulations and find that classical forcefields reproduce the NMR data quantitatively when the sampling is extended to the microseconds time-scale. Using the quantitative agreement of the NMR data as a validation of the model, we proceed to compare the conformational ensembles of the Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptide monomers. Our analysis confirms the existence of structured regions within the otherwise flexible Abeta peptides. We find that the C terminus of Abeta42 is more structured than that of Abeta40. The formation of a beta-hairpin in the sequence (31)IIGLMVGGVVIA involving short strands at residues 31-34 and 38-41 (in bold) reduces the C-terminal flexibility of the Abeta42 peptide and may be responsible for the higher propensity of this peptide to form amyloids.},

@article{Sipe:2000fs,
	Abstract = {Rudolph Virchow, in 1854, introduced and popularized the term amyloid to denote a macroscopic tissue abnormality that exhibited a positive iodine staining reaction. Subsequent light microscopic studies with polarizing optics demonstrated the inherent birefringence of amyloid deposits, a property that increased intensely after staining with Congo red dye. In 1959, electron microscopic examination of ultrathin sections of amyloidotic tissues revealed the presence of fibrils, indeterminate in length and, invariably, 80 to 100 A in width. Using the criteria of Congophilia and fibrillar morphology, 20 or more biochemically distinct forms of amyloid have been identified throughout the animal kingdom; each is specifically associated with a unique clinical syndrome. Fibrils, also 80 to 100 A in width, have been isolated from tissue homogenates using differential sedimentation or solubility. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the fibrils to be ordered in the beta pleated sheet conformation, with the direction of the polypeptide backbone perpendicular to the fibril axis (cross beta structure). Because of the similar dimensions and tinctorial properties of the fibrils extracted from amyloid-laden tissues and amyloid fibrils in tissue sections, they have been assumed to be identical. However, the spatial relationship of proteoglycans and amyloid P component (AP), common to all forms of amyloid, to the putative protein only fibrils in tissues, has been unclear. Recently, it has been suggested that, in situ, amyloid fibrils are composed of proteoglycans and AP as well as amyloid proteins and thus resemble connective tissue microfibrils. Chemical and physical definition of the fibrils in tissues will be needed to relate the in vitro properties of amyloid protein fibrils to the pathogenesis of amyloid fibril formation in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The progressive aggregation and deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in brain regions subserving memory and cognition is an early and invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of cognitive failure in aged humans. Inhibiting Abeta aggregation is therapeutically attractive because this process is believed to be an exclusively pathological event. Whereas many studies have examined the aggregation of synthetic Abeta peptides under nonphysiological conditions and concentrations, we have detected and characterized the oligomerization of naturally secreted Abeta at nanomolar levels in cultures of APP-expressing CHO cells [Podlisny, M. B., Ostaszewski, B. L., Squazzo, S. L., Koo, E. H., Rydell, R. E., Teplow, D. B., and Selkoe, D. J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 9564-9570 (1); Podlisny, M. B., Walsh, D. M., Amarante, P., Ostaszewski, B. L., Stimson, E. R., Maggio, J. E., Teplow, D. B., and Selkoe, D. J. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 3602-3611 (2)]. To determine whether similar species occur in vivo, we probed samples of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and detected SDS-stable dimers of Abeta in some subjects. Incubation of CSF or of CHO conditioned medium at 37 degrees C did not lead to new oligomer formation. This inability to induce oligomers extracellularly as well as the detection of oligomers in cell medium very early during the course of pulse-chase experiments suggested that natural Abeta oligomers might first form intracellularly. We therefore searched for and detected intracellular Abeta oligomers, principally dimers, in primary human neurons and in neuronal and nonneural cell lines. These dimers arose intracellularly rather than being derived from the medium by reuptake. The dimers were particularly detectable in neural cells: the ratio of intracellular to extracellular oligomers was much higher in brain-derived than nonbrain cells. We conclude that the pathogenically critical process of Abeta oligomerization begins intraneuronally.},

@article{Buell:2010p9457,
	Abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are filamentous aggregates of peptides and proteins implicated in a range of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It has been known almost since their discovery that these β-sheet-rich proteinacious assemblies bind a range of specific dyes that, combined with other biophysical techniques, are convenient probes of the process of amyloid fibril formation. Two prominent examples of such dyes are Congo red (CR) and Thioflavin T (ThT). It has been reported that in addition to having a diagnostic role, CR is an inhibitor of the formation of amyloid structures, and these two properties have both been explained in terms of the same specific noncovalent interactions between the fibrils and the dye molecules. In this article, we show by means of quartz-crystal microbalance measurements that the binding of both ThT and CR to amyloid fibrils formed by the peptide whose aggregation is associated with Alzheimer's disease, Aβ(1-42), can be directly observed, and that the presence of CR interferes with the binding of ThT. Light scattering and fluorescence measurements confirm that an interaction exists between these dyes that can interfere with their ability to reflect accurately the quantity of amyloid material present in a given sample. Furthermore, we show that CR does not inhibit the process of amyloid fibril elongation, and therefore demonstrate the ability of the quartz-crystal microbalance method not only to detect and study the binding of small molecules to amyloid fibrils, but also to elucidate the mode of action of potential inhibitors.},

@article{Wu:2011fd,
	Abstract = {Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is a neutral derivative of the fluorescent dye Thioflavin T (ThT), which displays enhanced hydrophobicity and binding affinity to amyloid fibrils. We present molecular dynamics simulations of binding of PIB and ThT to a common cross-β-subunit of the Alzheimer Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). Our simulations of binding to Aβ(9-40) protofibrils show that PIB, like ThT, selectively binds to the hydrophobic or aromatic surface grooves on the β-sheet surface along the fibril axis. The lack of two methyl groups and charge in PIB not only improves its hydrophobicity but also leads to a deeper insertion of PIB compared to ThT into the surface grooves. This significantly increases the steric, aromatic, and hydrophobic interactions, and hence leads to stronger binding. Simulations on protofibrils consisting of the more-toxic Aβ(17-42) revealed an additional binding mode in which PIB and ThT insert into the channel that forms in the loop region of the protofibril, sandwiched between two sheet layers. Our simulations indicate that the rotation between the two ring parts of the dyes is significantly more restricted when the dyes are bound to the surface of the cross-β-subunits or to the channel inside the Aβ(17-42) cross-β-subunit, compared with free solution. The specific conformations of the dyes are influenced by small chemical modifications (ThT versus PIB) and by the environment in which the dye is placed.},

@article{Baumketner:2008hd,
	Abstract = {Amyloid fibrils, large ordered aggregates of amyloid beta proteins (Abeta), are clinical hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aggregation properties of amyloid beta proteins can be strongly affected by single-point mutations at positions 22 and 23. The Dutch mutation involves a substitution at position 22 (E22Q) and leads to increased deposition rates of the AbetaE22Q peptide onto preseeded fibrils. We investigate the effect of the E22Q mutation on two key regions involved in the folding and aggregation of the Abeta peptide through replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of the 15-28 fragment of the Abeta peptide. The Abeta15-28 peptide encompasses the 22-28 region that constitutes the most structured part of the Abeta peptide (the E22-K28 bend), as well as the central hydrophobic cluster (CHC) (segment 17-21), the primary docking site for Abeta monomers depositing onto fibrils. Our simulations show that the 22-28 bend is preserved in the Abeta(15-28) peptide and that the CHC, which is mostly unstructured, interacts with this bend region. The E22Q mutation does not affect the structure of the bend but weakens the interactions between the CHC and the bend. This leads to an increased population of beta-structure in the CHC. Our analysis of the fibril elongation reaction reveals that the CHC adopts a beta-strand conformation in the transition state ensemble, and that the E22Q mutation increases aggregation rates by lowering the barrier for Abeta monomer deposition onto a fibril. Thermodynamic signatures of this enhanced fibrillization process from our simulations are in good agreement with experimental observations.},

	Abstract = {Previously, we have studied the minimal oligomer size of an aggregate amyloid seed and the mechanism of seed growth with a multilayer beta-sheet model. Under high temperature simulation conditions, our approach can test the stability of possible amyloid forms. Here, we report our study of oligomers of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) fragments 16-22, 16-35, and 10-35 (abbreviated Abeta(16-22), Abeta(16-35), and Abeta(10-35), respectively). Our simulations indicate that an antiparallel beta-sheet orientation is the most stable for the Abeta(16-22), in agreement with a solid state NMR-based model [Balbach, J. J., Ishii, Y., Antzutkin, O. N., Leapman, R. D., Rizzo, N. W., et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 13748-13759]. A model with twenty-four Abeta(16-22) strands indicates a highly twisted fibril. Whereas the short Abeta(16-22) and Abeta(24-36) may exist in fully extended form, the linear parallel beta-sheets for Abeta(16-35) appear impossible, mainly because of the polar region in the middle of the 16-35 sequence. However, a bent double-layered hairpin-like structure (called hook) with the polar region at the turn forms parallel beta-sheets with higher stability. An intra-strand salt-bridge (D23-K28) stabilizes the bent hairpin-like hook structure. The bent double-beta-sheet model for the Abeta(10-35) similarly offers oligomer stability.},

	Abstract = {Structural insight into the conformational changes associated with aggregation and assembly of fibrils has provided a number of targets for therapeutic intervention. Solid-state NMR, hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mutagenesis strategies have been used to probe the secondary and tertiary structure of amyloid fibrils and key intermediates. Rational design of peptide inhibitors directed against key residues important for aggregation and stabilization of fibrils has demonstrated effectiveness at inhibiting fibrillogenesis. Studies on the interaction between Abeta and cell membranes led to the discovery that inositol, the head group of phosphatidylinositol, inhibits fibrillogenesis. As a result, scyllo-inositol is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of AD. Additional small-molecule inhibitors, including polyphenolic compounds such as curcumin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and grape seed extract have been shown to attenuate Abeta aggregation through distinct mechanisms, and have shown effectiveness at reducing amyloid levels when administered to transgenic mouse models of AD. Although the results of ongoing clinical trials remain to be seen, these compounds represent the first generation of amyloid-based therapeutics, with the potential to alter the progression of AD and, when used prophylactically, alleviate the deposition of Abeta.},

	Abstract = {Aβ(1-42) is the highly pathologic isoform of amyloid-β, the peptide constituent of fibrils and neurotoxic oligomers involved in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies on the structural features of Aβ in water have suggested that the system can be described as an ensemble of distinct conformational species in fast exchange. Here, we use replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to characterize the conformations accessible to Aβ42 in explicit water solvent, under the ff99SB force field. Monitoring the correlation between J-coupling((3)J(H(N))(H(α))) and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data calculated from the REMD trajectories to their experimental values, as determined by NMR, indicates that the simulations converge towards sampling an ensemble that is representative of the experimental data after 60 ns/replica of simulation time. We further validate the converged MD-derived ensemble through direct comparison with (3)J(H(N))(H(α)) and RDC experimental data. Our analysis indicates that the ff99SB-derived REMD ensemble can reproduce the experimental J-coupling values with high accuracy and further provide good agreement with the RDC data. Our results indicate that the peptide is sampling a highly diverse range of conformations: by implementing statistical learning techniques (Laplacian eigenmaps, spectral clustering, and Laplacian scores), we are able to obtain an otherwise hidden structure in the complex conformational space of the peptide. Using these methods, we characterize the peptide conformations and extract their intrinsic characteristics, identify a small number of different conformations that characterize the whole ensemble, and identify a small number of protein interactions (such as contacts between the peptide termini) that are the most discriminative of the different conformations and thus can be used in designing experimental probes of transitions between such molecular states. This is a study of an important intrinsically disordered peptide system that provides an atomic-level description of structural features and interactions that are relevant during the early stages of the oligomerization and fibril nucleation pathways.},

@article{Bellesia:2010p9471,
	Abstract = {We explore the question of whether local effects (originating from the amino acids intrinsic secondary structure propensities) or nonlocal effects (reflecting the sequence of amino acids as a whole) play a larger role in determining the fold of globular proteins. Earlier circular dichroism studies have shown that the pattern of polar, non polar amino acids (nonlocal effect) dominates over the amino acid intrinsic propensity (local effect) in determining the secondary structure of oligomeric peptides. In this article, we present a coarse grained computational model that allows us to quantitatively estimate the role of local and nonlocal factors in determining both the secondary and tertiary structure of small, globular proteins. The amino acid intrinsic secondary structure propensity is modeled by a dihedral potential term. This dihedral potential is parametrized to match with experimental measurements of secondary structure propensity. Similarly, the magnitude of the attraction between hydrophobic residues is parametrized to match the experimental transfer free energies of hydrophobic amino acids. Under these parametrization conditions, we systematically explore the degree of frustration a given polar, non polar pattern can tolerate when the secondary structure intrinsic propensities are in opposition to it. When the parameters are in the biophysically relevant range, we observe that the fold of small, globular proteins is determined by the pattern of polar, non polar amino acids regardless of their instrinsic secondary structure propensities. Our simulations shed new light on previous observations that tertiary interactions are more influential in determining protein structure than secondary structure propensity. The fact that this can be inferred using a simple polymer model that lacks most of the biochemical details points to the fundamental importance of binary patterning in governing folding.},

@article{Soto:2007dm,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer{\&}apos;s disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder associated with the abnormal self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into fibrillar species. N-methylated peptides homologous to the central hydrophobic core of the Abeta peptide are potent inhibitors of this aggregation process. In this work, we use fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of the N-methylated peptide inhibitor Abeta16-20m (Ac-Lys(16)-(Me)Leu(17)-Val(18)-(Me)Phe(19)-Phe(20)-NH(2)) with a model protofilament consisting of Alzheimer Abeta16-22 peptides. Our simulations indicate that the inhibitor peptide can bind to the protofilament at four different sites: 1), at the edge of the protofilament; 2), on the exposed face of a protofilament layer; 3), between the protofilament layers; and 4), between the protofilament strands. The different binding scenarios suggest several mechanisms of fibrillogenesis inhibition: 1), fibril inhibition of longitudinal growth (in the direction of monomer deposition); 2), fibril inhibition of lateral growth (in the direction of protofilament assembly); and 3), fibril disassembly by strand removal and perturbation of the periodicity of the protofilament (disruption of fibril morphology). Our simulations suggest that the Abeta16-20m inhibitor can act on both prefibrillar species and mature fibers and that the specific mechanism of inhibition may depend on the structural nature of the Abeta aggregate. Disassembly of the fibril can be explained by a mechanism through which the inhibitor peptides bind to disaggregated or otherwise free Abeta16-22 peptides in solution, leading to a shift in the equilibrium from a fibrillar state to one dominated by inhibitor-bound Abeta16-22 peptides.},

	Abstract = {Congo red is a commonly used histological dye for amyloid detection. The specificity of this staining results from Congo red{\&}apos;s affinity for binding to fibril proteins enriched in beta-sheet conformation. Unexpectedly, recent investigations indicate that the dye also possesses the capacity to interfere with processes of protein misfolding and aggregation, stabilizing native protein monomers or partially folded intermediates, while reducing concentration of more toxic protein oligomers. Inhibitory effects of Congo red upon amyloid toxicity may also range from blockade of channel formation and interference with glycosaminoglycans binding or immune functions, to the modulation of gene expression. Particularly, Congo red exhibits ameliorative effect in models of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer{\&}apos;s, Parkinson{\&}apos;s, Huntington{\&}apos;s and prion diseases. Another interesting application of Congo red analogues is the development of imaging probes. Based on their small molecular size and penetrability through blood-brain barrier, Congo red congeners can be used for both antemortem and in vivo visualization and quantification of brain amyloids. Therefore, understanding mechanisms involved in dye-amyloidal fibril binding and inhibition of aggregation will provide instructive guides for the design of future compounds, potentially useful for monitoring and treating neurodegenerative diseases.},

	Abstract = {The fate of proteins with amyloidogenic properties depends critically on their immediate biochemical environment. However, the role of biological interfaces such as membrane surfaces, as promoters of pathological aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, is rarely studied and only established for the amyloid-beta protein (A beta) involved in Alzheimer's disease, and alpha-synuclein in Parkinsonism. The occurrence of binding and misfolding of these proteins on membrane surfaces, is poorly understood, not at least due to the two-dimensional character of this event. Clearly, the nature of the folding pathway for A beta protein adsorbed upon two-dimensional aggregation templates, must be fundamentally different from the three-dimensional situation in solution. Here, we summarize the current research and focus on the function of membrane interfaces as aggregation templates for amyloidogenic proteins (and even prionic ones). One major aspect will be the relationship between membrane properties and protein association and the consequences for amyloidogenic products. The other focus will be on a general understanding of protein folding pathways on two-dimensional templates on a molecular level. Finally, we will demonstrate the potential importance of membrane-mediated aggregation for non-amphiphatic soluble amyloidogenic proteins, by using the SOD1 protein involved in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis syndrome.},

	Abstract = {The aggregation of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide into oligomers/fibrils is one of the key pathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of naturally occurring small molecules for inhibiting protein aggregation has recently attracted many interests due to their effectiveness for treating protein folding diseases such as AD, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, and other amyloidosis diseases. alpha-d-Mannosylglycerate (MG), a natural extremolyte identified in microorganisms growing under extremely high temperatures up to 100 degrees C, had been shown to protect proteins against various stress conditions such as heat, freezing, thawing, and drying. Here, we report the effectiveness of MG on the suppression of Alzheimer's Abeta aggregation and neurotoxicity to human neuroblastoma cells. According to our study--carried out by using thioflavin-T induced fluorescence, atomic force microscopy, and cell viability assay--MG had significant inhibitory effect against Abeta amyloid formation and could reduce the toxicity of amyloid aggregates to human neuroblastoma cells while MG itself was innocuous to cells. On the other hand, the structural analogs of MG such as alpha-d-mannosylglyceramide, mannose, methylmannoside, glycerol, showed negligible effect on Abeta aggregate formation. The results suggest that MG could be a potential drug candidate for treating Alzheimer's disease.},

@article{Luheshi:2010gk,
	Abstract = {Protein aggregation, arising from the failure of the cell to regulate the synthesis or degradation of aggregation-prone proteins, underlies many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the balance between the synthesis, clearance, and assembly of misfolded proteins into neurotoxic aggregates remains poorly understood. Here we study the effects of modulating this balance for the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide by using a small engineered binding protein (Z(Abeta3)) that binds with nanomolar affinity to Abeta, completely sequestering the aggregation-prone regions of the peptide and preventing its aggregation. Co-expression of Z(Abeta3) in the brains of Drosophila melanogaster expressing either Abeta(42) or the aggressive familial associated E22G variant of Abeta(42) abolishes their neurotoxic effects. Biochemical analysis indicates that monomer Abeta binding results in degradation of the peptide in vivo. Complementary biophysical studies emphasize the dynamic nature of Abeta aggregation and reveal that Z(Abeta3) not only inhibits the initial association of Abeta monomers into oligomers or fibrils, but also dissociates pre-formed oligomeric aggregates and, although very slowly, amyloid fibrils. Toxic effects of peptide aggregation in vivo can therefore be eliminated by sequestration of hydrophobic regions in monomeric peptides, even when these are extremely aggregation prone. Our studies also underline how a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments provide mechanistic insight with regard to the relationship between protein aggregation and clearance and show that engineered binding proteins may provide powerful tools with which to address the physiological and pathological consequences of protein aggregation.},

	Abstract = {The amyloid cascade hypothesis states that overproduction of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta/AbetaP) or failure to clear this peptide, leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily through amyloid deposition, presumed to be involved in neurofibrillary tangle formation; these lesions are then associated with cell death which is reflected in memory impairment, the hallmarks of this dementia. The abundant evidence that Abeta aggregation/oligomerization is an essential early event in AD pathogenesis has prompted intensive search for therapeutics that target various conformations of Abeta. Several labs have bred AD diseased models of transgenic mice that produce human Abeta and develop plaques and neuron damage in their brains as well as immunological aspects of the disease pathogenesis. The immune system appears to participate in AD pathogenesis. There is evidence for partial tolerance against Abeta in mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice as well as in AD patients. Animal models of the disease enabled the immunological concept for treatment of conformational diseases to gain more attention and immunization approaches are being pursued in order to stimulate clearance of brain amyloid plaques. In spite of the first clinical setback, this research field has clearly strengthened the hypothesis that Abeta plays a central role in AD and has stimulated a new area for development of Alzheimer's therapeutics. The renewed human phase clinical trials toward improved immunotherapeutic strategies which maintain the beneficial effects without adverse side effects are under further evaluation.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is the largest unmet medical need in neurology. Current drugs improve symptoms, but do not have profound disease-modifying effects. However, in recent years, several approaches aimed at inhibiting disease progression have advanced to clinical trials. Among these, strategies targeting the production and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide - a cardinal feature of Alzheimer's disease that is thought to be important in disease pathogenesis - are the most advanced. Approaches aimed at modulating the abnormal aggregation of tau filaments (another key feature of the disease), and those targeting metabolic dysfunction, are also being evaluated in the clinic. This article discusses recent progress with each of these strategies, with a focus on anti-amyloid strategies, highlighting the lessons learned and the challenges that remain.},

@article{Wang:2010p4440,
	Abstract = {Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the extracellular deposition of fibrillar aggregates of beta-amyloid (Abeta), transient oligomeric species of Abeta are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Natively unfolded monomeric Abeta can misfold and progressively assemble into fibrillar aggregates, following a well-established "on pathway" seeded-nucleation mechanism. Here, we show that three simple saccharides, mannose, sucrose, and raffinose, alter Abeta aggregation kinetics and morphology. The saccharides inhibit formation of Abeta fibrils but promote formation of various oligomeric aggregate species through different "off pathway" aggregation mechanisms at 37 degrees C but not at 60 degrees C. The various oligomeric Abeta aggregates formed when coincubated with the different saccharides are morphologically distinct but all are toxic toward SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, increasing the level of toxicity and greatly prolonging toxicity compared with Abeta alone. As a wide variety of anti-Abeta aggregation strategies are being actively pursued as potential therapeutics for AD, these studies suggest that care must be taken to ensure that the therapeutic agents also block toxic oligomeric Abeta assembly as well as inhibit fibril formation.

@article{Takeda:2010gx,
	Abstract = {Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are considered as potential therapeutic agents against Alzheimer's disease. Using replica exchange molecular dynamics and atomistic implicit solvent model, we studied the mechanisms of binding of naproxen and ibuprofen to the Abeta fibril derived from solid-state NMR measurements. The binding temperature of naproxen is found to be almost 40 K higher than of ibuprofen implicating higher binding affinity of naproxen. The key factor, which enhances naproxen binding, is strong interactions between ligands bound to the surface of the fibril. The naphthalene ring in naproxen appears to provide a dominant contribution to ligand-ligand interactions. In contrast, ligand-fibril interactions cannot explain differences in the binding affinities of naproxen and ibuprofen. The concave fibril edge with the groove is identified as the primary binding location for both ligands. We show that confinement of the ligands to the groove facilitates ligand-ligand interactions that lowers the energy of the ligands bound to the concave edge compared with those bound to the convex edge. Our simulations appear to provide microscopic rationale for the differing binding affinities of naproxen and ibuprofen observed experimentally.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. This amyloid primarily contains amyloid-beta (Abeta), a 39- to 43-aa peptide derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the endogenous amyloid precursor protein. The 42-residue-length Abeta peptide (Abeta(1-42)), the most abundant Abeta peptide found in plaques, has a much greater propensity to self-aggregate into fibrils than the other peptides and is believed to be more pathogenic. Synthetic human Abeta(1-42) peptides self-aggregate into stable but poorly-ordered helical filaments. We determined their structure to approximately 10-A resolution by using cryoEM and the iterative real-space reconstruction method. This structure reveals 2 protofilaments winding around a hollow core. Previous hairpin-like NMR models for Abeta(17-42) fit well in the cryoEM density map and reveal that the juxtaposed protofilaments are joined via the N terminus of the peptide from 1 protofilament connecting to the loop region of the peptide in the opposite protofilament. This model of mature Abeta(1-42) fibrils is markedly different from previous cryoEM models of Abeta(1-40) fibrils. In our model, the C terminus of Abeta forms the inside wall of the hollow core, which is supported by partial proteolysis analysis.},

	Abstract = {The use of osmolytes or chaperones to stabilize proteins/peptides that misfold in neurodegenerative diseases is an attractive concept for drug development. We have investigated the role of a series of small carbohydrates for protection of the natively structured Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). Using circular dichroism spectroscopy to follow the beta-structural transitions and electron microscopy to examine tertiary structural characteristics, we demonstrate that the hydrogen bonding capacity of the carbohydrate determines the inhibition or promotion of fibrillogenesis. Three sugar molecules that vary only in their distribution of potential H-bonding partners promote various structural changes in Abeta. Two of these sugar molecules are excluded from Abeta during aggregation and promote mature fibre growth, while the other binds Abeta promoting nucleation and the accumulation of protofibrils. Our studies suggest that utilization of a combinatorial strategy to alter H-bonding capacity across a simple carbohydrate molecule may represent a novel drug design strategy.},

	Abstract = {The misfolding and self-assembly of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP or amylin) into amyloid fibrils is pathologically linked to type II diabetes. The polymorphic nature of both hIAPP oligomers and fibrils has been implicated for the molecular origin of hIAPP toxicity to islet β-cells, but little is known about the polymorphic structure and dynamics of these hIAPP oligomers/fibrils at the atomic level. Here, we model the polymorphism of full length hIAPP1-37 oligomers based on experimental data from solid-state NMR, mass per length, and electron microscopy using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation with explicit solvent. Alternative to steric zipper structures mostly presented in the 2-fold symmetrical fibrils, the most striking structural feature of our proposed hIAPP oligomers is the presence of 3-fold symmetry along the fibril growth axis, in which three β-sheet-layers wind around a hydrophobic core with different periodicities. These 3-fold triangular hIAPP structures that dramatically differ in the details of β-layer assembly and core-forming sequence at the cross section, but all display a high structural stability with favorable layer-to-layer interactions. The 3-fold hIAPP structures can also serve as templates to present triple-stranded helical fibrils via peptide elongation, with different widths from 8.7 nm to 9.9 nm, twists from 2.8$\,^{\circ}$ to 11.8$\,^{\circ}$, and pitches from 14.5 nm to 61.1 nm, in reasonable agreement with available biophysical data. Because similar 3-fold Aβ oligomers are also observed by both NMR experiments and our previous simulations, 3-fold structure could be a general conformation to a broad range of amyloid oligomers and fibrils. Most importantly, unlike the conventional stacking sandwich model, the proposed wrapping-cord structures can readily accommodate more than three β-layers via a two dimension conformation search by rotating and translating the β-layers to adopt different favorable packings, which can greatly enrich the polymorphism of amyloid oligomers and fibrils.},

	Abstract = {The conformational behavior of the wild-type amyloid β-42 (Aβ-42) monomer and two of its mutants was explored via all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent, to identify structural features that may promote or deter early-stage oligomerization. The markers used for this purpose indicate that while the three peptides are relatively flexible they have distinct preferential structures and degree of rigidity. In particular, we found that one mutant that remains in the monomeric state in experiments displays a characteristic N-terminal structure that significantly enhances its rigidity. This finding is consistent with various studies that have detected a reduction in oligomerization frequency and Aβ-related toxicity upon sequence-specific antibody or ligand binding to the N-terminal tail of wild-type monomers, likely leading to the stabilization of this region. In general, our results highlight a potential role of the N-terminal segment on Aβ oligomerization and give insights into specific interactions that may be responsible for promoting the pronounced structural changes observed upon introducing point mutations on the wild-type Aβ-42 peptide.},

	Abstract = {The formation of nonfibrillar oligomers has been proposed as a common element of the aggregation pathway of proteins and peptides associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. While fibrillar structures have long been considered indicators of diseases linked with the accumulation of amyloid plaques, it has more recently been proposed that amyloid oligomers are in fact the cytotoxic form. Here we describe the local structure and dynamics of stable oligomers formed by a peptide comprising residues 106-126 of the human prion protein (PrP). Structural constraints from solid-state NMR reveal quaternary packing interactions within the hydrophobic core, similar to those previously reported for amyloid fibrils formed by this peptide, and consistent with structural studies of oligomers formed by the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide. However, a hydration-dependent increase in disorder is observed for nonfibrillar oligomers of PrP(106-126). In solution NMR spectra we observe narrow (1)H and (13)C resonances corresponding to a monomer in exchange with the approximately 30 nm diameter nonfibrillar oligomers, giving additional information on the molecular structure of these species. Taken together, our data support a model in which the local structure of the oligomers contains the basic elements of amyloid fibrils, but with long-range disorder and local mobility that distinguishes these assemblies from the fibrillar form of PrP(106-126). These characteristics may provide a basis for the differing biological activities of amyloid fibrils and oligomers.},

	Abstract = {Peptides comprising residues 106-126 of the human prion protein (PrP) exhibit many features of the full-length protein. PrP(106-126) induces apoptosis in neurons, forms fibrillar aggregates, and can mediate the conversion of native cellular PrP (PrP(C)) to the scrapie form (PrP(Sc)). Despite a wide range of biochemical and biophysical studies on this peptide, including investigation of its propensity for aggregation, interactions with cell membranes, and PrP-like toxicity, the structure of amyloid fibrils formed by PrP(106-126) remains poorly defined. In this study we use solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance to define the secondary and quaternary structure of PrP(106-126) fibrils. Our results reveal that PrP(106-126) forms in-register parallel beta sheets, stacked in an antiparallel fashion within the mature fibril. The close intermolecular contacts observed in the fibril core provide a rational for the sequence-dependent behavior of PrP(106-126), and provide a basis for further investigation of its biological properties.},

	Abstract = {Previous experimental studies have demonstrated changing the ionic strength of the solvent to have a great impact on the mechanism of aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein leading to distinct fibril morphology at high and low ionic strength. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the ionic strength-dependent effects on the structure and dynamics of the model Aβ fibril. The change in ionic strength was brought forth by varying the NaCl concentration in the environment surrounding the Aβ fibril. Comparison of the calculated vibrational spectra of Aβ derived from 40 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at different ionic strength reveals the fibril structure to be stiffer with increasing ionic strength. This finding is further corroborated by the calculation of the stretching force constants. Decomposition of binding and dynamical properties into contributions from different structural segments indicates the elongation of the fibril at low ionic strength is most likely promoted by hydrogen bonding between N-terminal parts of the fibril, whereas aggregation at higher ionic strength is suggested to be driven by the hydrophobic interaction.},

	Abstract = {The accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein in the brain reflects the cognitive impairment noted in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that brain Abeta disappeared and cognitive improvement occurred as a result of passive or active Abeta immunization. Peripheral administration of nonimmunization substances, such as GM1 ganglioside, also reduced brain Abeta. Therefore, we hypothesized that the rapid removal of Abeta from the blood by an extracorporeal system may act as a peripheral Abeta sink from the brain. In the present study, we investigated the Abeta removal activity of medical materials as a first step toward the design of an Abeta removal system. First, the removal activities of six materials were studied for Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) by batch analysis in albumin solution or in human plasma for 1-16 h. Two of the six materials reduced the Abeta concentrations by 90-99% within 1 h. Next, the two effective materials, hexadecyl-alkylated cellulose particles (HDC) and charcoal, were analyzed in a continuous single-pass system with minicolumns. Both materials showed around 81-90% removal activity for more than 2 h, which corresponded to over 4 l of plasma treatment in humans. In a human extracorporeal system, HDC also removed both Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) from whole blood circulation. In conclusion, biomedical materials were found that could remove Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) effectively in an extracorporeal system. It is now conceivable that further studies can be undertaken to reduce Abeta concentrations in the brain to improve cognitive function.},

	Abstract = {The conformational states sampled by the Alzheimer amyloid beta (10-35) (Abeta 10-35) peptide were probed using replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations in explicit solvent. The Abeta 10-35 peptide is a fragment of the full-length Abeta 40/42 peptide that possesses many of the amyloidogenic properties of its full-length counterpart. Under physiological temperature and pressure, our simulations reveal that the Abeta 10-35 peptide does not possess a single unique folded state. Rather, this peptide exists as a mixture of collapsed globular states that remain in rapid dynamic equilibrium with each other. This conformational ensemble is dominated by random coil and bend structures with insignificant presence of an alpha-helical or beta-sheet structure. The 3D structure of Abeta 10-35 is seen to be defined by a salt bridge formed between the side-chains of K28 and D23. This salt bridge is also observed in Abeta fibrils and our simulations suggest that monomeric conformations of Abeta 10-35 contain pre-folded structural motifs that promote rapid aggregation of this peptide.},

@article{Wang:2010p5887,
	Abstract = {One of the key factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the conversion of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) from its soluble random coil form into various aggregated forms. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been proved effective in preventing the aggregation of Abeta, but the thermodynamic mechanisms are still unclear. In this work, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was utilized to study the interactions between Abeta42 and EGCG at different temperatures, salt concentrations, pH values, and EGCG and Abeta42 concentrations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the hydrogen bonding between Abeta42 and EGCG. The results indicate that the binding stoichiometry N is linearly related to the EGCG/Abeta42 ratio. Hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding are both substantial in the binding process, but the extent of their contributions changes with experimental conditions. Namely, the predominant interaction gradually shifts from a hydrogen bonding to a hydrophobic interaction with the increase of the EGCG/Abeta42 ratio, resulting in a transition of the binding from enthalpy-driven to entropy-driven. This experimental observation is validated by the MD simulations. The binding of EGCG to Abeta42 can be promoted by increasing temperature and salt concentration and changing pH away from Abeta42's pI. The findings have provided new insight into the molecular interactions between Abeta42 and EGCG from a thermodynamic perspective and are expected to facilitate the research on the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation.},

@article{Sandberg:2010ix,
	Abstract = {Soluble oligomeric aggregates of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the conformation adopted by Abeta within these aggregates is not known, a beta-hairpin conformation is known to be accessible to monomeric Abeta. Here we show that this beta-hairpin is a building block of toxic Abeta oligomers by engineering a double-cysteine mutant (called Abetacc) in which the beta-hairpin is stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond. Abeta(40)cc and Abeta(42)cc both spontaneously form stable oligomeric species with distinct molecular weights and secondary-structure content, but both are unable to convert into amyloid fibrils. Biochemical and biophysical experiments and assays with conformation-specific antibodies used to detect Abeta aggregates in vivo indicate that the wild-type oligomer structure is preserved and stabilized in Abetacc oligomers. Stable oligomers are expected to become highly toxic and, accordingly, we find that beta-sheet-containing Abeta(42)cc oligomers or protofibrillar species formed by these oligomers are 50 times more potent inducers of neuronal apoptosis than amyloid fibrils or samples of monomeric wild-type Abeta(42), in which toxic aggregates are only transiently formed. The possibility of obtaining completely stable and physiologically relevant neurotoxic Abeta oligomer preparations will facilitate studies of their structure and role in the pathogenesis of AD. For example, here we show how kinetic partitioning into different aggregation pathways can explain why Abeta(42) is more toxic than the shorter Abeta(40), and why certain inherited mutations are linked to protofibril formation and early-onset AD.},

	Abstract = {Revealing the structure and aggregation mechanism of amyloid fibrils is essential for the treatment of over 20 diseases related to protein misfolding. Coherent two-dimensional (2D) infrared spectroscopy is a novel tool that provides a wealth of new insight into the structure and dynamics of biomolecular systems. Recently developed ultrafast laser sources are extending multidimensional spectroscopy into the ultraviolet (UV) region, and this opens up new opportunities for probing fibrils. In a simulation study, we show that 2DUV spectra of the backbone of a 32-residue beta-amyloid (Abeta(9-40)) fibril associated with Alzheimer's disease and two intermediate prefibrillar structures carry characteristic signatures of fibril size and geometry that could be used to monitor its formation kinetics. The dependence of these signals on the fibril size and geometry is explored. We demonstrate that the dominant features of the beta-amyloid fibril spectra are determined by intramolecular interactions within a single Abeta(9-40), and intermolecular interactions at the "external interface" have clear signatures in the fine details of these signals.},

@article{Vitalis:2010ik,
	Abstract = {Aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, a 39- to 43-residue fragment of the amyloid precursor protein, is associated with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia in the elderly population. Several experimental studies have tried to characterize the atomic details of amyloid fibrils, which are the final product of Aβ aggregation. Much less is known about species forming during the early stages of aggregation, in particular about the monomeric state of the Aβ peptide that may be viewed as the product of the very first step in the hypothesized amyloid cascade. Here, the equilibrium ensembles of monomeric Aβ alloforms Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations using an atomistic force field and implicit solvent model that have been shown previously to correctly reproduce the ensemble properties of other intrinsically disordered polypeptides. Our simulation results indicate that at physiological temperatures, both alloforms of Aβ assume a largely collapsed globular structure. Conformations feature a fluid hydrophobic core formed, on average, by contacts both within and between the two segments comprising residues 12-21 and 24-40/42, respectively. Furthermore, the 11 N-terminal residues are completely unstructured, and all charged side chains, in particular those of Glu22 and Asp23, remain exposed to solvent. Taken together, these observations indicate a micelle-like† architecture at the monomer level whose implications for oligomerization, as well as fibril formation and elongation, are discussed. We establish quantitatively the intrinsic disorder of Aβ and find the propensity to form regular secondary structure to be low but sequence specific. In the presence of a global and unspecific bias for backbone conformations to populate the β-basin, the β-sheet propensity along the sequence is consistent with the arrangement of the monomer within the fibril, as derived from solid-state NMR data. These observations indicate that the primary sequence partially encodes fibril structure, but that fibril elongation must be thought of as a templated assembly step.},

@article{Gruschus:2008hq,
	Abstract = {Mounting evidence points to soluble peptide oligomers as the primary agents in various amyloid and prion diseases. Multiple mechanisms appear to contribute to the cytotoxic effects of these oligomers. Here, an additional, general mechanism is proposed - that soluble amyloid peptide oligomers serve as "all-purpose"beta strands that can interact with transiently unfolded or nascent proteins where interior beta-sheet edges are exposed. The proteins, trapped in misfolded states through this interaction, become substrates for ubiquitination, targeting them for proteasomal degradation. The increased load of ubiquitinated proteins could contribute to the impairment of the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) seen in many amyloid-related diseases. This "misfolding trap" mechanism could be especially stressful in the endoplasmic reticulum, where the amyloid oligomers would compete with chaperones for nascent beta-sheet proteins. If the bound amyloid oligomer dissociates at some point after the misfolded protein is committed to the UPS pathway, the oligomer could then repeat the process, adding a catalytic aspect to the misfolding mechanism. Direct proof of this proposed mechanism requires detection of amyloid oligomer-beta-sheet protein complexes, and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment is proposed. This hypothesis supports therapies that increase amyloid oligomer degradation or sequestration, as well as therapies that upregulate chaperone activity, for combating amyloid-related diseases.},

@article{Li:2010p5928,
	Abstract = {Oligomeric forms of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are key neurotoxins in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we found that C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of Abeta42 interfered with assembly of full-length Abeta42 and inhibited Abeta42-induced toxicity. To decipher the mechanism(s) by which CTFs affect Abeta42 assembly and neurotoxicity, here, we investigated the interaction between Abeta42 and CTFs using photoinduced cross-linking and dynamic light scattering. The results demonstrate that distinct parameters control CTF inhibition of Abeta42 assembly and Abeta42-induced toxicity. Inhibition of Abeta42-induced toxicity was found to correlate with stabilization of oligomers with a hydrodynamic radius (R(H)) of 8-12 nm and attenuation of formation of oligomers with an R(H) of 20-60 nm. In contrast, inhibition of Abeta42 paranucleus formation correlated with CTF solubility and the degree to which CTFs formed amyloid fibrils themselves but did not correlate with inhibition of Abeta42-induced toxicity. Our findings provide important insight into the mechanisms by which different CTFs inhibit the toxic effect of Abeta42 and suggest that stabilization of nontoxic Abeta42 oligomers is a promising strategy for designing inhibitors of Abeta42 neurotoxicity.},

	Abstract = {As research progresses toward understanding the role of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease, certain aspects of the aggregation process for Abeta are still not clear. In particular, the accepted constitution of toxic aggregates in neurons has shifted toward small oligomers. However, the process of forming these oligomers in cells is also not full clear. Even more interestingly, it has been implied that cell membranes, and, in particular, anionic lipids within those membranes, play a key role in the progression of Abeta aggregation, but the exact nature of the Abeta-membrane interaction in this process is unknown. In this work, we use a thermodynamic cycle and umbrella sampling molecular dynamics to investigate dimerization of the 42-residue Abeta peptide on model zwitterionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or model anionic dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) bilayer surfaces. We determined that Abeta dimerization was strongly favored through interactions with the DOPS bilayer. Further, our calculations showed that the DOPS bilayer promoted strong protein-protein interactions within the Abeta dimer, whereas DPPC favored strong protein-lipid interactions. By promoting dimer formation and subsequent dimer release into the solvent, the DOPS bilayer acts as a catalyst in Abeta aggregation.},

@article{Horn:2010p3446,
	Abstract = {Recent experimental data demonstrate that small, soluble amyloid-beta42 oligomers play an important role in Alzheimer's disease because they exhibit neurotoxic properties and also act as seed for fibril growth. We performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent of 0.7 mus in total on five Abeta9-42 oligomers (monomer through pentamer) starting from the fibril conformation. The initial conformation proves to be stable in the trimer to pentamer, and the two parallel in-register beta-sheets as well as the connecting turn are preserved. The dimer undergoes larger conformational changes in its C-terminus, and the predominant conformation detected exhibits an additional antiparallel beta-sheet in one of the subunits. This conformational rearrangement allows efficient shielding of hydrophobic residues from the solvent, which is not possible for a dimer in the fibril conformation. In addition to the presence of the hydrogen bonds in the beta-sheets, the larger oligomers are stabilized by interchain D23-K28 salt bridges, whereas a D23-N27 interaction is found in the dimer. The degree of structural similarity to the fibril conformation detected for the oligomers in the simulation may also offer a structural explanation for the experimental finding that trimers and tetramers act as more potent seeds in fibril formation than dimers because only small conformational changes will be required for fibril growth. The fact that the dimer predominantly exists in conformations distinct from the larger oligomers and the fibril is also interesting for the design of anti-Alzheimer drugs, because it suggests that multiple drugs might be required to target the structurally different neurotoxic oligomers.},

@article{Kalhor:2009p2236,
	Abstract = {In searching for alternative ways to reduce or inhibit amyloid formation, we have studied this process using hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) in the presence of a low concentration of protic ionic liquids. The ionic liquids were synthesized in a combinatorial fashion maintaining the cationic part (tetramethylguanidinium) with alteration of the anionic component of each compound tested. It was observed that one of these compounds (tetramethylguanidinium acetate) inhibited amyloid formation of HEWL in vitro by nearly 50%. Examination under transmission electron microscopy confirmed the fibril inhibition, and fibrils were observed to be morphologically thinner. To investigate the mechanism of inhibition, intrinsic fluorescence, ANS binding, and circular dichroism analyses were performed. These analyses indicated that the native structure of HEWL was maintained in the presence of the ionic liquid. Performing native PAGE and nondenaturing agarose electrophoresis, it became evident that some of the intermediate oligomers were not converted to protofibrils and that the oligomers were trapped in more stable conformations. Additionally, it was observed that this inhibitory effect was related to the ionic liquid itself and not the solvated ions. It also became evident that the carboxyl functional group was important in the inhibition. The size of the anions and kosmotropicity did not play significant roles in the fibril inhibition.},

@article{deSimone:2008db,
	Abstract = {Deposition of insoluble amyloid plaques is frequently associated with a large variety of neurodegenerative diseases. However, data collected in the last decade have suggested that the neurotoxic action is exerted by prefibrillar, soluble assemblies of amyloid-forming proteins and peptides. The scarcity of structural data available for both amyloid-like fibrils and soluble oligomers is a major limitation for the definition of the molecular mechanisms linked to the onset of these diseases. Recently, the structural characterization of GNNQQNY and other peptides has shown a general feature of amyloid-like fibers, the so-called steric zipper motif. However, very little is known still about the prefibrillar oligomeric forms. By using replica exchange molecular dynamics we carried out extensive analyses of the properties of several small and medium GNNQQNY aggregates arranged through the steric zipper motif. Our data show that the assembly formed by two sheets, each made of two strands, arranged as in the crystalline states are highly unstable. Conformational free energy surfaces indicate that the instability of the model can be ascribed to the high reactivity of edge backbone hydrogen bonding donors/acceptors. On the other hand, data on larger models show that steric zipper interactions may keep small oligomeric forms in a stable state. These models simultaneously display two peculiar structural motifs: a tightly packed steric zipper interface and a large number of potentially reactive exposed strands. The presence of highly reactive groups on these assemblies likely generates two distinct evolutions. On one side the reactive groups quickly lead, through self-association, to the formation of ordered fibrils, on the other they may interfere with several cellular components thereby generating toxic effects. In this scenario, fiber formation propensity and toxicity of oligomeric states are two different manifestations of the same property: the hyper-reactivity of the exposed strands.},

@article{Kassler:2010p3484,
	Abstract = {Converging lines of evidence suggest that soluble A beta-amyloid oligomers play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and present direct effectors of synaptic and cognitive dysfunction. Three pathological E22-A beta-amyloid point mutants (E22G, E22K, E22Q) and the deletion mutant E22 Delta exhibit an enhanced tendency to form prefibrillar aggregates. The present study assessed the effect of these four mutations using molecular dynamics simulations and subsequent structural and energetic analyses. Our data shows that E22 plays a unique role in wild type A beta, since it has a destabilising effect on the oligomer structure due to electrostatic repulsion between adjacent E22 side chains. Mutations in which E22 is replaced by an uncharged residue result in higher oligomer stability. This effect is also observed to a lesser extent for the E22K mutation and is consistent with its lower pathogenicity compared to other mutants. Interestingly, deletion of E22 does not destroy the amyloid fold but is compensated by local changes in the backbone geometry that allow the preservation of a structurally important salt bridge. The finding that all mutant oligomers investigated exhibit higher internal stability than the wild type offers an explanation for the experimentally observed enhanced oligomer formation and stability.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are considered to play causal roles in the pathogenesis of amyloid-related degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes mellitus, the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and prion disease. The mechanism of fibril formation is still hotly debated and remains an important open question. In this study, we utilized molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to analyze the stability of hexamer for eight class peptides. The MD results suggest that VEALYL and MVGGVV-1 are the most stable ones, then SNQNNY, followed by LYQLEN, MVGGVV-2, VQIVYK, SSTSAA, and GGVVIA. The statistics result indicates that hydrophobic residues play a key role in stabilizing the zipper interface. Single point and two linkage mutants of MVGGVV-1 confirmed that both Met1 and Val2 are key hydrophobic residues. This is consistent with the statistics analysis. The stability results of oligomer for MVGGVV-1 suggest that the intermediate state should be trimer (3-0) and tetramer (2-2). These methods can be used in stabilization study of other amyloid fibril.},

	Abstract = {Protein and peptide aggregation into amyloid plaques is associated with a large variety of neurodegenerative diseases. The definition of the molecular bases of these pathologies is hampered by the transient nature of pre-fibrillar small-oligomers that are considered the toxic species. The ability of the peptide GNNQQNY to form amyloid-like structures makes it a good model to investigate the complex processes involved into amyloid fiber formation. By employing full atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations, we constructed the free energy surface of small assemblies of GNNQQNY to gain novel insights into the fiber formation process. The calculations suggest that the peptide exhibits a remarkable tendency to form both parallel and antiparallel beta-sheets. The data show that GNNQQNY preference for parallel or antiparallel beta-sheets is governed by a subtle balance of factors including assemblies' size, sidechain-sidechain interactions and pH. The samplings analysis provides a rationale to the observed trends.},

@article{Wu:2010p3548,
	Abstract = {Soluble amyloid oligomers are potent neurotoxins that are involved in a wide range of human degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease. In Alzheimer disease, amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers bind to neuronal synapses, inhibit long term potentiation, and induce cell death. Recent evidence indicates that several immunologically distinct structural variants exist as follows: prefibrillar oligomers (PFOs), fibrillar oligomers (FOs), and annular protofibrils. Despite widespread interest, amyloid oligomers are poorly characterized in terms of structural differences and pathological significance. FOs are immunologically related to fibrils because they react with OC, a conformation-dependent, fibril-specific antibody and do not react with antibodies specific for other types of oligomers. However, fibrillar oligomers are much smaller than fibrils. FOs are soluble at 100,000 x g, rich in beta-sheet structures, but yet bind weakly to thioflavin T. EPR spectroscopy indicates that FOs display significantly more spin-spin interaction at multiple labeled sites than PFOs and are more structurally similar to fibrils. Atomic force microscopy indicates that FOs are approximately one-half to one-third the height of mature fibrils. We found that Abeta FOs do not seed the formation of thioflavin T-positive fibrils from Abeta monomers but instead seed the formation of FOs from Abeta monomers that are positive for the OC anti-fibril antibody. These results indicate that the lattice of FOs is distinct from the fibril lattice even though the polypeptide chains are organized in an immunologically identical conformation. The FOs resulting from seeded reactions have the same dimensions and morphology as the initial seeds, suggesting that the seeds replicate by growing to a limiting size and then splitting, indicating that their lattice is less stable than fibrils. We suggest that FOs may represent small pieces of single fibril protofilament and that the addition of monomers to the ends of FOs is kinetically more favorable than the assembly of the oligomers into fibrils via sheet stacking interaction. These studies provide novel structural insight into the relationship between fibrils and FOs and suggest that the increased toxicity of FOs may be due to their ability to replicate and the exposure of hydrophobic sheet surfaces that are otherwise obscured by sheet-sheet interactions between protofilaments in a fibril.},

@article{Kim:2005p2252,
	Abstract = {Aggregation of proteins into insoluble deposits is associated with a variety of human diseases. In Alzheimer disease, the aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is believed to play a key role in pathogenesis. Although the 40-mer (Abeta40) is produced in vivo at higher levels than the 42-mer (Abeta42), senile plaque in diseased brains is composed primarily of Abeta42. Likewise, in vitro, Abeta42 forms fibrils more rapidly than Abeta40. The enhanced amyloidogenicity of Abeta42 could be due simply to its greater length. Alternatively, specific properties of residues Ile(41) and Ala(42) might favor aggregation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we constructed a library of sequences in which residues 41 and 42 were randomized. The aggregation behavior of the resulting sequences was assessed using a high throughput screen, based on the finding that fusions of Abeta42 to green fluorescence protein (GFP) prevent the folding and fluorescence of GFP, whereas mutations in Abeta42 that disrupt aggregation produce green fluorescent fusions. Correlations between the sequences of Abeta42 mutants and the fluorescence of Abeta42-GFP fusions in vivo were confirmed in vitro through biophysical studies of synthetic 42-residue peptides. The data reveal a strong correlation between aggregation propensity and the hydrophobicity and beta-sheet propensities of residues at positions 41 and 42. Moreover, several mutants containing hydrophilic residues and/or beta-sheet breakers at positions 41 and/or 42 were less prone to aggregate than Abeta40 wherein these two residues are deleted entirely. Thus, properties of the side chains at positions 41 and 42, rather than length per se, cause Abeta42 to aggregate more readily than Abeta40.},

	Abstract = {Oligomers of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) play a central role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Of the two predominant Abeta alloforms, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), Abeta(1-42) is more strongly implicated in the disease. We elucidated the structural characteristics of oligomers of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) and their Arctic mutants, [E22G]Abeta(1-40) and [E22G]Abeta(1-42). We simulated oligomer formation using discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) with a four-bead protein model, backbone hydrogen bonding, and residue-specific interactions due to effective hydropathy and charge. For all four peptides under study, we derived the characteristic oligomer size distributions that were in agreement with prior experimental findings. Unlike Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42) had a high propensity to form paranuclei (pentameric or hexameric) structures that could self-associate into higher-order oligomers. Neither of the Arctic mutants formed higher-order oligomers, but [E22G]Abeta(1-40) formed paranuclei with a similar propensity to that of Abeta(1-42). Whereas the best agreement with the experimental data was obtained when the charged residues were modeled as solely hydrophilic, further assembly from spherical oligomers into elongated protofibrils was induced by nonzero electrostatic interactions among the charged residues. Structural analysis revealed that the C-terminal region played a dominant role in Abeta(1-42) oligomer formation whereas Abeta(1-40) oligomerization was primarily driven by intermolecular interactions among the central hydrophobic regions. The N-terminal region A2-F4 played a prominent role in Abeta(1-40) oligomerization but did not contribute to the oligomerization of Abeta(1-42) or the Arctic mutants. The oligomer structure of both Arctic peptides resembled Abeta(1-42) more than Abeta(1-40), consistent with their potentially more toxic nature.},

@article{Masman:2009p6410,
	Abstract = {Amyloid oligomers are considered to play causal roles in the pathogenesis of amyloid-related degenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Using MD simulation techniques, we explored the contributions of the different structural elements of trimeric and pentameric full-length Abeta1-42 aggregates in solution to their stability and conformational dynamics. We found that our models are stable at a temperature of 310 K, and converge toward an interdigitated side-chain packing for intermolecular contacts within the two beta-sheet regions of the aggregates: beta1 (residues 18-26) and beta2 (residues 31-42). MD simulations reveal that the beta-strand twist is a characteristic element of Abeta-aggregates, permitting a compact, interdigitated packing of side chains from neighboring beta-sheets. The beta2 portion formed a tightly organized beta-helix, whereas the beta1 portion did not show such a firm structural organization, although it maintained its beta-sheet conformation. Our simulations indicate that the hydrophobic core comprising the beta2 portion of the aggregate is a crucial stabilizing element in the Abeta aggregation process. On the basis of these structure-stability findings, the beta2 portion emerges as an optimal target for further antiamyloid drug design.},

@article{Wu:2010p3553,
	Abstract = {The presence of amyloid deposits consisting primarily of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibril in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The morphologies of these fibrils are exquisitely sensitive to environmental conditions. Using molecular dynamics simulations combined with data from previously published solid-state NMR experiments, we propose the first atomically detailed structures of two asymmetric polymorphs of the Abeta(9-40) peptide fibril. The first corresponds to synthetic fibrils grown under quiescent conditions and the second to fibrils derived from AD patients' brain-extracts. Our core structure in both fibril structures consists of a layered structure in which three cross-beta subunits are arranged in six tightly stacked beta-sheet layers with an antiparallel hydrophobic-hydrophobic and an antiparallel polar-polar interface. The synthetic and brain-derived structures differ primarily in the side-chain orientation of one beta-strand. The presence of a large and continually exposed hydrophobic surface (buried in the symmetric agitated Abeta fibrils) may account for the higher toxicity of the asymmetric fibrils. Our model explains the effects of external perturbations on the fibril lateral architecture as well as the fibrillogenesis inhibiting action of amphiphilic molecules.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism of amyloidosis of amyloid beta (1-42) (Abeta (1-42)) was investigated by the well-defined glycocluster interface. We prepared monovalent, divalent, and trivalent 6-sulfo-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (6S-GlcNAc) immobilized substrates. The morphology and secondary structure of Abeta (1-42) aggregates on the substrates were investigated by dynamic-mode AFM and FTIR-RAS. Abeta (1-42) interactions with multivalent sugars were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance, and the cytotoxicity of Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Morphological images showed, interestingly, that Abeta (1-42) aggregates had a tendency to form globules rather than fibrils as the valency of 6S-GlcNAc on the substrate was increased. The SPR measurements indicated that this morphological change of Abeta (1-42) was related to the change of binding mode, and the binding mode was dependent on the multivalency of the sugar. Globular Abeta (1-42) was more toxic than fibrillar Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells. These results suggested that the multivalency of sugars for the amyloidosis of Abeta (1-42) was significant in its morphology and aggregation effects at the surface of the cell membrane mimic.},

Aggregation into amyloidlike fibrils occurs via three main mechanisms: (i) formation of fibrils directly from the assembly of early ordered oligomers, (ii) fibril formation via the formation of on-pathway, nonfibrillar aggregates high in beta-sheet content, and (iii) formation of amorphous aggregates followed by reorganization to beta-sheet aggregates and to fibrils. beta-sheet, nonfibrillar aggregates also appeared as long-lived, "off-pathway" end-product species.},
