\subsection{Drug development for AD}

The results of our simulation here start to define a pharmacophore for treating AD, opening the way to computer-aided design of improved diagnostics and therapeutics.
According to wiki: A pharmacophore is an abstract description of molecular features which are necessary for molecular recognition of a ligand by a biological macromolecule.

Speculate on the future of drug development for AD in regards to the significance of thesis wrt curing AD.

Will blocking aggregation work for AD? - May be this should in the introduction instead.

(WRITE SOME CONCLUSIONS HERE … RELATING TO HOW A SINGLE SMALL MOLECULE BINDS SPECIFIC MORPHOLOGICAL STRUCTURES -- clearly a key result of my works demonstrate that there is sequence specificity) Because different amyloid polymorphs may bind different small molecules, it is likely that in the future, a cocktail of compounds may be required for treating Alzheimer’s disease and other amyloid therapies. (Adapted from pharmacophore for AD 2011) rather than one  miracle drug. Because AD has many pathways of damage, it is possible that, like cancer, that it is many disorders rolled into one. % JoAnne thinks it will be a combination of drugs as well.

\section{Significance for disordered binding}

[Thesis significance - part of the summary of what I make of my thesis ] This thesis demonstrates the applicability of MD simulations for this purposes in understanding how drugs might bind to amyloidogenic species and intrinsically disordered peptides. 

[Conclusions - A general interest in the specific work that I have done here ]   Our results also are feasible for understanding small molecule binding to disordered peptides (IDPs) in general. This thesis sheds light on the mechanism of binding disordered peptides, and represents a step forward in understanding how small molecules may prevent protein - protein interactions, which involves identifying the binding interfaces, and understanding how to target these interfaces using small molecules.REFs.


\section{MD simulations and Rational drug design}

Understanding how small molecules may interact with intrinsically disordered proteins goes beyond amyloid-related disorders.  As IDPs are involved in many signalling pathways, they are also viable drug targets for many diseases.   Hence, targeting these disordered peptides using small molecules may be a possible therapeutic approach. For example, c-Myc is frequently involved in many cancers, … FILL IN THE GAP ABOUT HOW IT WORKS … and thus disruption of the c-Myc-Max interaction is a possible anticancer strategy.\cite{  Iakoucheva, L.M., Brown, C.J., Lawson, J.D., Obradovic, Z. and Dunker, A.K. (2002) Intrinsic disorder in cell-signaling and cancer-associated proteins. J. Mol. Biol. 323, 573–584 .}\cite{Metallo:2010p6822,Cuchillo:2012bm}

\section{MD simulation as a tool for probing weak interactions}
This thesis has demonstrated that MD simulations, and the current force fields can effectively probe weak and transient interactions, which are often not readily detectable using experimental techniques. One prominent example where weak interactions are prominent in protein-ligand binding is protein-carbohydrate interactions.\cite{weak binding review paper}

Understanding Protein-sugar interactions is an important endeavor because of antibody binding to proteins.  Viruses often express carbohydrates on their coats.  Inhibiting bacterial action involves knowing how polysaccharrides are expressed, which involves binding proteins.  The use of all of these studies is to eventually develop antibacterial therapeutics. % sounds like this belongs in the introduction.

% The role of simulations in drug discovery to effectively predict binding modes and binding sites

[Thesis significance; more perspectives] Traditionally computation studies probing protein-ligand binding is often carried out with the knowledge of a putative binding site (often determined by X-ray crystallography) and the mechanism is examined employing complicated methods using the ligands thought to be able to bind in this specific pocket, while ignoring all other possibilities.  However, with enough computing power to extend simulations to a long time, longer time scale MD simulations can be accurate in discovering new binding sites (even sites that are XXX high in affinity) without having to make any prior assumptions about the binding site. Our studies are among those which demonstrate the utility of MD to probe for binding sites that are not possible to be obtained via experimental structural determination methods.  A recent MD study have demonstrated the capability of MD in binding site prediction for a folded protein...\cite{Shan:2011bo}

% Shan, 2011 (the DE shaw letter) An emerging challenge in drug discovery concerns the identification of allosteric ligand-binding sites (I’m not entirely convinced yet that this is important -- because I can’t think of any situations where this might be important -- convince myself or just drop this idea), through which drugs can modulate the effects of ligands that bind at the primary site.  More generally, an important limitation of traditional virtual drug screening is that it must start with a well-defined binding site (look into limitations of current drug discovery processes … may give some clue for constructing an argument for how MD is helping …), despite promising recent developments.\cite{Hetenyi, C.; van der Spoel, D. FEBS Lett. 2006, 580, 1447. (11) Davis,I.W.;Raha,K.;Head,M.S.;Baker,D.ProteinSci.2009, 18, 1998. }


\subsection{Osmolyte effects, denaturation, and macromolecular crowding}
% Note this is another hairy field … and you might want to stay the hell away from it, despite the fact that your thesis is loosely connected to this field

Another field of interest where weak interactions dominates is understanding cosolvent effects on peptide folding. Simulations are a good use for probing that.  For example, MD simulations have been useful in gaining insight into protein denaturation mechanisms by urea or guanidinium, and the activity of osmolytes. Many of these are still open questions.\cite{http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp200625k -- crowding and protein association.} Where am I going with this?

% These ideas below are  lesser developed ideas … consider cutting or bulk up …
% \section{other areas that are related to my work}
% [Ab-GAG membrane binding] This branches off the fact that I looked at sugar binding with peptides - amyloids when deposited may interact with glycosaminoglycans (part of the extracellular matrix) exposed at cellular surfaces. So what about it? Is my work helping to understand how amyloids are interacting with GAGs? or what role GAGs might play in accelerating amyloid formation?


% \subsection{Relationship to Polypharmacology -- where one drug binds to different targets?}
% Not sure my thesis relates to this.


\section{In the future - perspectives on computer simulations}
% TODO: Find out why are there so few new drugs being discovered nowadays?
% Expand simulations into the macroscopic level 

% TODO: A good thought experiment - If I had the perfect simulation system? Predictive force field, simulate milliseconds in days.  How could I use this simulation system? Some effective use of the data?
