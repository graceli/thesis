\chapter{Conclusions and Future Directions}
% Funnel out!

% AD What's next for this project
If I had to go big and scale up my project, what would I reasonably do? 
Simulating different small molecules with different peptide aggregation states 
Going longer - move to longer timescales 

% What new thing have I learned in all this?

% Speculate on the future of AD
Does blocking aggregation work?
JoAnne thinks it will be a combination of drugs .. not just one miracle drugs.  Why? 
AD many pathways of damage - Is it possible that its just like cancer? ... that is its a bunch of diseases wrapped into one ... not just a single disease?
	

Understanding Protein-sugar interactions is an important endeavor because of antibody binding to proteins.  Viruses often express carbohydrates on their coats.  Inhibiting bacterial action involves knowing how polysaccharrides are expressed, which involves binding proteins.  The use of all of these studies is to eventually develop antibacterial therepeutics. 

Simulations can be used to effectively probe weak interactions that are not readily detectable using experimental techniques.

Software has the ability to revolutionize drug discovery and take it from bench to personalized medicine.  Why are there so few new drugs being discovered nowadays?

The role of simulations in drug discovery to effectively predict binding modes and binding sites. Role of simulations in rational drug design - can drive experiments and generate testable hypotheses. 

Expand simulations into the macroscopic level 

Virtual drug screening using MD simulations as a component predicting drug toxicity.

What happens if I had the perfect simulation system? Predictive force field, simulate milliseconds in days.  How could I use this simulation system?
Some effective use of the data? 

Most Useful to “somehow” integrate experimental data with simulations results
- What are some success stories?
what’s the real problem with drugs?
Can we do without drugs? What are the therapies available?
Small molecule
peptide
antibodies
gene therapy (viral)
