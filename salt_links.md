Notes on salt links related stuff

- Consider writing this paper in markdown
	- markdown draft is started with the originally written stuff on this project dated back to 2004!
	
### What's the story so far for this paper?
	- how does salt link assoc. change with temp?
	- thermodynamics, kinetics?
	- What's next after this ... full protein? P450cam ???

### Why write it?
- Good branch off for the guanidinium + SH3 project
- Protein stability
	- helps answer the question what is the difference between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins?
			- Number of salt bridges! But why?
